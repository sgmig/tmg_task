Description
Features
Product series & properties
Applications
Description
Primer, also called adhesion promoter or chemical bridges, function as a bonding layer between the substrate and the adhesive, and improve the adhesion. They are used mainly on surfaces which are difficult to bond or in applications with very high demands regarding resistance against moisture and heat. Many Jowat primers contain highly dispersed silica acid which expands the surface and facilitates a permanent bond.
Applying an primer which is compatible with the specific adhesive is often the most suitable or the only method to achieve an optimum adhesion to the substrate. In addition, the primer may also function as a barrier protecting the surface against infiltration of water or other external elements, and therefore significantly increase the ageing resistance and permanent tack of the surface finishing.
Primers are usually applied in a thin film to ensure a proper drying of the coating. Due to the long-lasting effect of the dried primer, the primer application and the bonding process can generally be carried out independently at different times. Depending on the material, some substrates may require an “oxidative pretreatment” before the primer is applied. Adhesion to the substrate and the cohesion of the primer film can be improved by mixing the primer with a crosslinking agent.
For some materials (e.g. PP), it is absolutely necessary to add a crosslinking agent.
Features
Primer provide the following benefits:
universal use of adhesives
adhesion to the most different materials
permanent bonds to meet the strictest requirements
frequently, preserving the surface pretreatment
Product series & properties
Jowat
®
Primer (water-based)
Basis
: Polyurethane
Properties
: Water-based primers are physically curing systems. Polymer chains and highly dispersed silica acids are kept suspended in a liquid and provide the adhesive properties once the liquid has evaporated.
Packaging
: Liquid; buckets, hobbocks, drums, IBC
Jowat
®
Primer (solvent-based)
Basis:
Polyurethane; ethylene vinyl acetate; PVC
Properties:
Solvent-based primers consist of polymers (also called binding agents) which are dissolved in a solvent, and dispersed silica acids which are the “solid component” in the polymer solution. The transition from the liquid processing state to the final solid state is facilitated by the solvent. It functions as a transport and processing agent for the binding agents and the silica acids, and is also aggressive enough to bite the surface of the primered substrate and to ensure the necessary bond strength during joining. Jowat supplies a range of special solvent-based primers for a multitude of substrates, e.g. for PVC, ABS, PP and PET.
Packaging:
Liquid; buckets, hobbocks, drums, IBC
Jowat
®
Wash Primer (solvent-based)
Basis:
Polyurethane; PVC
Properties:
Solvent-based wash primers do not contain silica acids. Therefore, they can be applied by felt or vacuum systems. Wash primers are available as classic solvent-based formulations as well as so-called VOC-reduced primers. The latter have a VOC content between 20 and 49 percent, which is a maximum content 50 % lower compared to classic systems. Primers from this product line are mainly used for the pretreatment of PVC window profiles to remove extrusion rests and external lubricants from the surface.
Packaging:
Liquid; canister, hobbocks, drums, IBC

2. Notes on application responsibility and necessary suitability tests
Gluing as one of the most efficient methods of bonding is constantly gaining importance and expanding into new areas of application. At the same time, the number of substrates to be bonded is also growing at an unprecedented rate. New methods and equipment to process adhesives are developed.
The in-house R & D departments of Jowat are responding with intensive efforts to keep pace with these constant changes. A highly qualified team of chemists and engineers is using the latest techniques and brightest ideas to provide the utmost in advice our customers and to make sure that they get the adhesive which meets their needs.
Our information is based on test results from our laboratories as well as on experience gained in the field by our customers. This advice, however, cannot cover all eventualities for each specific application and as such is not binding for us. Please, contact our technical service department in each case to find out what the actual technical state of development for the respective product is, and request the latest data sheet. Any use of our product without this precautionary measure would be your sole responsibility.
The processing company itself must therefore test the adhesives manufactured by us for suitability in each individual case. This applies to the first use of a sample as well as to modifications during an ongoing production.
We are therefore requesting all our new customers to test our adhesives for suitability on original parts at conditions equal to normal processing conditions. The bond has then to be subjected to the actual stress which it would undergo when in use and has to be assessed. This test is absolutely necessary.
Customers who undertake modifications during a running production are requested to pass this information on to us. Please notify us when machines are set to new parameters as well as when the substrates to be bonded are changed. Only then will Jowat be able to provide our most up-to-date information to the processor using our adhesives.
The information given is based on practical experience and on results of tests in our laboratory, and does in no way constitute any guarantee of properties. No liability may be derived from these indications nor from the recommendations made by our technical advisory service.

Application Description
We spend most of our time in cars sitting. Therefore, the seats are exposed to a lot of stress during the life cycle of a car. Apart from durability and sturdiness, requirements for appearance, material quality and ergonomics are increasing here as well.
Adhesive technology from Jowat is also used in seats and seat covers. Our special adhesives are used for instance for the coating or covering of the back of seats. NFPP substrates are laminated with a foil using a PUR hot melt to protect the back of the seats against mechanical stress. Our high-performance reactive PUR bonding solutions are also demanded for laminating for instance PU foam with leather, plastic foils or other textiles. These materials are usually supplied laminated and on reels for downline processing in the manufacture of car seats.

Application Description

Application Description
Sheet lamination of printed paper material is a widely used finishing method for many different products, for instance folders, book covers, board games, jigsaw puzzles or display packaging. Laminated cardboards made of a corrugated cardboard base and laminated with printed paper are manufactured on sheet-to-sheet laminators with a laminating section and a delivery section. In the lamination process, different materials with a high-quality pre-printed surface are bonded to a cardboard or corrugated cardboard substrate. A gluing unit applies the adhesive to the flute tips (open flute) or the top layer of the carrier substrate and aligns it with the printed top sheet. In the final step, the substrates are then bonded together. The adhesive has to meet special requirements: facilitate clean processing on roller applicators, no foaming, no odour, and excellent flatness of the compound – with maximum adhesion.
POS displays
Placed prominently in retail stores, from supermarkets to pharmacies and petrol stations, eye-catching point-of-sale displays draw the customers’ attention to special offers and product campaigns. Due to the generally limited lifecycle, they must be easy to handle while also providing enough stability for the products showcased in them. Enterprises also have to react spontaneously and fast to new market developments.
Therefore, POS displays need to be manufactured from a sustainable material which can be disposed in an environmentally sensitive way once the promotion has ended. Jowat has developed special dispersion adhesives for this purpose to join the printed papers and the carrier material (in this application, usually corrugated cardboard).
Board games
While online games have become increasingly popular among young and old alike, classic board games still hold a strong appeal to game lovers.
Board games are also manufactured by laminating a carrier substrate with a pre-printed paper. To ensure the highest quality possible in this process, Jowat has developed special Jowacoll
®
dispersion adhesives that withstand the high stress to which the material is exposed. Glues from the Jowacoll
®
series also facilitate superior results in the manufacture of folders.
Jowat has many years of experience in bonding all types of papers and cardboards – whether on highly absorbent greyboard, in the overlapping area, paper with plastic content or printed with digital printing inks. The dispersion adhesives, crosslinking agents and cleaners by Jowat are perfectly adapted to each other and meet all individual requirements: excellent adhesion, no wave structures, and optimum LayFlat properties.

Application Description
Pleated filter media are made from a wide variety of materials, such as for instance paper or different nonwoven fabrics. Thermoplastic adhesives for filters from Jowat for pleating and frame bonding are characterised by a broad spectrum of adhesion. In addition, they also function as a sealant, give the filters stability and facilitate highly reliable processes. Due to the special characteristics of these adhesives, the finished filters keep their form throughout their life cycle even while the compound is exposed to mechanical stress e.g. during installation or to high temperatures of over 180 °C. Special polyolefin hot melts can be used for pleating as well as for filter frame bonding and meet all necessary requirements.
Jowat-Toptherm
®
adhesives provide structural properties due to their superior bonding characteristics on papers and fleece materials, and also the excellent mechanical resistance when used for pleating or frame assembly operations. They get the filters in shape and always remain flexible over the entire life of the filter. They do not undergo deformation, even when the material compound is exposed to mechanical forces or high temperatures.
Pleating
Engine intake air filters are good examples to explain the importance of these pleated filters. They need to guarantee that the high-performance components are protected against potential damages from rust, pollen, dust, tire abrasion, sand, and other dirt, allowing the engine to operate with efficient combustion and without damage. The pleating in this case functions to enlarge the surface while taking up only a small space.
Since the filter materials and also the manufacturing methods differ widely, the adhesives utilized for the pleating process demand special properties: an open time adapted to the line speed, a high initial or green strength / handling stability and a high temperature resistance
Filter papers soaked with phenolic resin undergo thermal processes after pleating which may expose them to temperatures up to 180 °C, and of course, the adhesives must withstand this stress.
Frame bonding
The engine compartments of today’s cars are becoming more and more compact, and in consequence allow only very limited space for the air filters. When these are exchanged in the course of maintenance, the filter elements are heavily deformed, which then also requires superior resistance of the bonded frames. The adhesive, specifically the adhesive joint, may not fail, and the filter pockets must remain sealed. Additionally, the performance of the filter element may not be diminished in any way by the adhesive.

Description
Features
Product Series & Properties
Applications
Description
Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) are physically hardening systems which are characterised by a permanent tackiness. Bonds are made by applying pressure on the adhesive film – the more pressure is applied, the better is the adhesion. Pressure-sensitive adhesives are frequently used for precoating due to their permanent tack which allows a joining of the substrates before as well as after the adhesive has set. Therefore, the bonding can be carried out independently of the adhesive application in a different place and at a different time.
Pressure-sensitive adhesives from Jowat are characterised by good adhesion to different materials, and a high strength coupled with high flexibility. The modern adhesives impress with an outstanding initial strength and a very stable viscosity during processing.
Features
Pressure-sensitive hot melt adhesives provide the following benefits:
a 100 % solids content, free of solvents
high production speeds due to short setting times
wide range of adhesion to different materials
they can level out irregularities in the surface
elastic bondline
can be reactivated by heat and therefore be used for precoating
joint can be opened by heating (recycling)
Product Series & Properties

PSA Hot Melt | Jowat-Toptherm

PSA Hot Melt
Basis
: EVA, polyolefin and rubber
Properties
: In addition to excellent initial tack, pressure-sensitive adhesives also provide a good adhesion to surfaces which are difficult to bond. They also facilitate bonds with very good shear and peeling resistances. However, these properties depend largely on the application amount and on the surfaces to be bonded. Pressure-sensitive adhesives based on rubber have a low resistance to solvents and plasticisers, and a limited heat resistance.
Jowatherm
®
PSA can be processed with standard hot melt spray guns, nozzle applicators, roller and blade systems.

Data protection
Data protection
Welcome on our website and thank you for your interest in us and our products. We take the protection of your personal information very seriously and want you to feel safe when visiting our website. Therefore, we would like to inform you of the scope of the personal data we collect and for what purpose it is used. We take data protection very seriously and treat personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal requirements. New technologies and the development of our website may require that we adapt this data protection policy. We therefore recommend that you read it again in regular intervals. The definitions for the terms used in this data protection policy are available in Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (of the GDPR).
1. Technically necessary data / access data
Due to technical reasons, it is necessary for your internet browser to transmit some data (“server log files”) to our web server when you access our website. The following data is recorded during an active connection in order to facilitate the communication between your internet browser and our website, to ensure a smooth connection to the website, and to provide a comfortable and user-friendly browsing experience:
domain requested
IP address of the visitor
request date and time
request method
page path
status code
referrer (where did the request originate)
user agent with browser and operating system version
The data is used exclusively for troubleshooting purposes and, if necessary, for forensic analysis. The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and log files is Article 6(1) point (f) of the GDPR.
That data is stored temporarily for technical security reasons, in particular to protect against cyberattacks on our web server. That data does not allow the identification of individuals. The IP address is shortened to the domain level at the latest
seven
days after it has been collected. This is done in order to anonymise the data and make it impossible to identify individual users.
In addition, the anonymised data may be processed for statistical purposes.
At no point is the data stored together with other personal data of the user, compared with other databases or passed on to third parties.
1.1 Reach measurement
This website uses cookies for a pseudonymised reach analysis. These cookies are transferred to the user’s browser either by our own server or by a server of a third party.
1.2 Cookies
Our website uses so-called “cookies” with different functions.
Cookies are small text files that are stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on the user’s device. Many cookies are necessary for technical purposes because some website features would not function otherwise (e.g. the shopping cart or language settings).
Other cookies may be used to analyse user behaviour or to display advertisements. The use of cookies increases the user-friendliness and safety of this website. These files are accessed by your browser. Session cookies are deleted automatically at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them or until they are deleted automatically by our browser.
The storing of cookies that are necessary technically (permanent cookies) takes place based on Article 6(1) point (f) of the GDPR. The technically flawless and optimised provision of our services constitutes a legitimate interest. Cookies in this category are e.g. Usercentrics Consent Management Platform, TYPO3, reCAPTCHA.
Other cookies (session cookies) are only stored with your consent based on Article 6(1) point (a) of the GDPR. You can withdraw your consent for the future at any time. Cookies in this category are e.g. Google Maps, YouTube Video, Google Analytics.
The legal basis can be derived from Article 6(1) point (b) of the GDPR if the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering the contract.
If cookies are used for analytical purposes, we will inform you thereof separately within the framework of this data protection policy and ask for your consent.
You can also manage and make changes to different cookie settings in your browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.).
1.3 Cookie management
Advertising cookies used by many companies and functions can also be managed individually. To do this, use the corresponding user tools.
In addition, most browsers have a so-called “Do Not Track” function, which signals that you do not want to be tracked. If that function is enabled, the browser will send a signal to the websites you visit that you do not wish to be tracked for targeted advertising or similar purposes. Information and instructions on how to change those settings are provided by your browser provider.
You can also prevent so-called scripts from loading by default. NoScript allows determine on which domains you want to enable the execution of JavaScript, Java and other plug-ins. Information and instructions on how to change those settings are provided by your browser provider.
Please note that some features of this website may not function properly if cookies are deactivated.
You can withdraw or change your cookie preferences at any time. To do so, open the cookie settings by clicking or tapping the integrated fingerprint icon on our website. It is located in the bottom left corner of the website.
2. Processing of personal data
Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as name, etc.
If the opportunity for the input of personal or business data (e-mail addresses, names, addresses) is given, that information is provided voluntarily.
2.1 Handling of data from the contact form
We collect and process your data that you choose to provide via the contact form. In doing so we comply with the legal provisions concerning the erasure of data. The controller pursuant to the data protection legislation is Jowat.
When you contact us via the contact form, we ask for your location, name, and e-mail address. You may also provide further voluntary information if you choose so.
2.2 Handling of data from applications
By sending application materials, the applicant consents for the data transferred (e.g. first and last name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) to be stored in accordance with the legal provisions.
If you transmit additional personal data, you expressly consent to allowing Jowat to collect, process and use that data within the framework of the application process. That data will be processed in accordance with this privacy policy and the other relevant legal provisions.
In the event of a negative decision or if the application is rejected, the data transferred will be erased no later than 6 months after the application processes has ended. This shall not apply if erasing the data would be against legal provisions or if the data is necessary for establishing a claim.
If a contract is signed following the application, your data may be stored and used for the purpose of the standard organisational and administrative process, in compliance with the relevant legal provisions.
If we cannot offer you a vacancy at present and if, based on your profile, we think that your application could also be interesting for future job openings, we will store your personal application data for twelve months, provided that you expressly consent to such a storage and use.
You can object to the storage of your application data at any time. The data will be erased without undue delay after we have received your objection. You may send your objection to personal@jowat.de. You also have the right to withdraw your application at any time.
We expressly point out that applications, especially CVs, certificates, and further data you provide, could contain extremely sensitive information (e.g. regarding mental and physical health). If you transmit such information together with your application, you expressly consent to that data being collected, processed, and used by Jowat for job filling purposes.
In addition, we point out that the data you send may be used to create statistics about the application process. Those statistics are created exclusively for our own purposes and are always anonymous, in no case personalised. Further information is available at:
https://www.jowat.com/de-DE/datenschutz/bewerbung/
3. Information shared with third parties
Personal information will not be passed on to third parties without your consent. Personal information will only be collected and passed on to state institutions and authorities within the framework of the relevant legislation and as per court order. All of our employees and service providers are bound not to disclose any personal information as well as to compliance with the data protection policy.
3.1 External links
Jowat does not control or have any influence on the content and data protection policy of other websites linked to on our website. If you follow a link to another website, we recommend reading the data protection policies on those websites to determine whether and to what extent they collect, process or use personal data, or make it accessible to third parties.
3.2 Processing by external service providers on our behalf
In addition, we also use services from carefully chosen external providers with a written mandate from us. The service providers are bound to our instructions and are regularly monitored by us. Where applicable, we have concluded the necessary processing contracts in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR.
The service providers are responsible for webhosting, the sending of e-mails as well as the maintenance and upkeep of our IT systems, etc. The service providers will not pass that information on to third parties.
4. Analysis and tracking
4.1 Use of Google Maps
This website uses Google Maps (API) provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland (“Google”). Google Maps is a web mapping service for the presentation of geographic data in a visual form. It enables us to show our location on a map and makes finding us easier.
When you access a page on which Google Maps are embedded, information about your use of our website (e.g. your IP address) will be transferred to and stored on Google’s servers. Information may also be transferred to the servers of Google LLC. In the USA.
This is independent of whether you are signed in with a user account provided by Google or whether a user account exists. When you are signed in on Google, the information will be linked directly to your account. If you do not want that information to be linked to your Google profile, you must sign out before activating the button.
The data stored by Google (incl. of users who are not signed in) is used for creating and analysing usage profiles. On the basis of legitimate interest, Google collects, stores and analyses the data to display personalised advertising, for market research and/or for tailoring of Google websites. You have the right to object to user profiles being created. To make use of this right, you must contact Google.
If you do not consent to a future transfer of your data to Google within the framework of using Google Maps, you also have the possibility to completely disable the web service of Google Maps by deactivating the JavaScript application in your browser. Google Maps can then no longer be used and maps will not be displayed on this website.
The Google Terms of Service are available at
https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/terms/regional.html
The additional Terms of Service for Google Maps are available at
https://www.google.com/intl/en_US/help/terms_maps.html
Detailed data protection information concerning the use of Google Maps is available on Google’s website (“Google Privacy Policy”):
https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/
4.2 Use of Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
The analysis of your use of the website is made possible by storing so-called “cookies” on your computer, which then generate information about your usage behaviour and forward it to Google Inc. In general, your IP address is shortened before it is forwarded to Google Server. In exceptional cases, the complete IP address may also be forwarded. Google uses this information on our behalf to compile a report about the user behaviour on our pages. The IP address determined by Google Analytics is not coupled with other data from Google. You can prevent cookies from being stored on your computer by setting the appropriate preferences in your browser. Unfortunately, this may result in a limited use of our webpages.
You can prevent Google Analytics from collectiong data. To do so, open the cookie settings by clicking or tapping the integrated fingerprint icon on our website. It is located in the bottom left corner of the website. This will set an opt-out cookie, which prevents the collecting of your data when you visit this website.
Further information about the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy is available at
http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/en.html
and at
https://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/
Please observe that the code “anonymizeIp” has been added to Google Analytics on this website to facilitate the anonymization of the IP addresses collected (so-called IP masking).
4.3 ReCaptcha
This website also uses the reCAPTCHA function provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland (“Google”).
The primary purpose of this function is to determine whether information entered on our website comes from a physical person or is the result of automated machine processing (in order to identify bots, e.g. when filling in online forms).
The service includes the transmission of IP addresses as well as further data needed by Google for the reCAPTCHA service if necessary to Google, pursuant to Article 6(1) point (f) of the GDPR based on our legitimate interest in establishing individual liability on the internet and in preventing misuse and spam. Within the framework of the use of Google reCAPTCHA, personal data may also be transferred to the servers of Google LLC. in the USA.
4.4 YouTube Video
We use YouTube.com as a platform to upload and publish our own videos. YouTube is a service provided by a third party not associated with us - YouTube LLC (Google/YouTube: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland).
Our website contains links to YouTube. We are generally not responsible for the content on linked websites. If you follow a link to YouTube, please observe that YouTube store and use the data of their users (e.g. personal information, IP address) for commercial purposes in accordance with their own data use policy.
Data policy of the third party:
https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en
5. Duration for which personal data is stored
The duration for which personal data is stored depends on the relevant legal retention periods (e.g. pursuant to commercial law and tax law). The data is erased routinely after the corresponding retention period has ended. If the data is necessary for the execution or initiation of a contract or if we have a legitimate interest in a further storing, the data will be erased when it is no longer necessary for that purpose or when you have used your right of revocation or objection.
6. Data transfer to third countries
As described above, we use the services of providers in so-called third countries (for instance the USA), i.e. countries which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Union. If this is the case and if the European Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision (Article 45 of the GDPR) for that country, we have taken the necessary measures to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfer. This includes e.g. the standard contract provisions of the European Union or binding internal data protection rules.
In the cases where that is not possible, the transfer of data is based on exceptions in Article 49 of the GDPR, in particular on your express consent or the necessity of the transfer to fulfil a contract.
The decision on whether to transfer data to the USA by clicking a social media link or a US social media service as well as the related responsibility lie with the user. Jowat SE and its subsidiary cannot assume any liability for the transfer of data to the USA.
When a page is loaded, the initial view will only show a preview image of the link or video. That image is stored on our own servers. After the first click, the following message will be displayed:
“By accessing the content you consent to transferring your data to (YouTube LLC USA, etc…) and confirm that you have read the Data Protection Policy.”
Only after you have clicked on accept, will the page or YouTube video be started in the extended data protection mode. The data protection policies of the external page or provider apply in that case. The data processing takes only place with your consent, which you give by clicking the link of the social media provider (e.g. LinkedIn) or by expressly starting a YouTube video following the aforementioned two-click procedure.
If the data is transferred to a third country and there is no adequacy decision nor a suitable guarantee, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the corresponding third country (e.g. intelligence services) gain access to the transferred data to collect and analyse it and that the enforcement of your rights cannot be guaranteed.
You will also be informed of the lack of an adequate data protection level of such services, you will also be informed through the cookie banner.
7. Access to personal data
You can find out if and what personal information Jowat holds about you, upon request and free of charge. Please inform us of any incorrect data concerning your person, so that we can correct, lock, or delete it. If you have further questions relating to our data protection policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Data subjects have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the information outlined in Article 15 of the GDPR.
Data subjects have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the
rectification
of inaccurate personal data concerning them, as well as to have incomplete personal data completed.
In addition, data subjects have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning them without undue delay where one of the grounds outlined in Article 17 of the GDPR applies, e.g. if the data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected (
right to be forgotten
).
Data subjects have the right to obtain from the controller
restriction
of processing where one of the conditions outlined in Article 18 of the GDPR applies, e.g. where the data subject has objected to processing pending the verification by the controller.
Data subjects have the right to
object
, on grounds relating to their particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning them. The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Article 21 of the GDPR).
Data subjects have the right to receive personal data concerning them which they have provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
format
. Data subjects have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where the processing is based on consent or on a contract (Article 20 of the GDPR). This right shall not apply if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, the rights and freedoms of another person are affected, and the transmission would not be technically feasible.
Data subjects have the right to withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on a consent (according to Article 6(1) point (a) or Article 9(2) point (a) of the GDPR).
If we process your data based on a legitimate interest, you have the right to object to the processing of your data due to reasons arising from your special situation. If the objection is against data processing for direct advertising purposes, you have a general right to object for which you do not need to give a reason.
To exercise your rights described above, please contact the person specified below. This also applies if you wish to receive a copy of a guarantee as evidence of an adequate level of data protection.
Data subjects have the right to be informed of the possible consequences of failure to provide the personal data.
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes the of the GDPR (art. 77 of the GDPR). The data subject can lodge the complaint with a supervisory authority in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement. The competent authority in the federal state of
North Rhine-Westphalia
is the North Rhine-Westphalia Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LDI NRW), Kavalleriestr. 2-4 in 40213 Düsseldorf. In
Sachsen-Anhalt
, the competent authority is the Data Protection Commissioner of Sachsen-Anhalt, Leiterstr. 9 in 39104 Magdeburg.
Further information will be provided by Jowat if the purpose of personal data processing changes.

Application Description
Customers looking for the most suitable mattress can choose from a wealth of options. Foam mattresses with an increasing number of layers of latex, memory or gel foam are in vogue.
In the manufacture of foam mattresses, an increasing number of layers of sometimes different foams are laminated to each other. The adhesive used in this application has to be highly flexible and adhere to a wide range of materials. PUR hot melt adhesives meet these demands and provide a significantly faster build-up of strength compared to the frequently used dispersion adhesives. Therefore they facilitate more efficient manufacturing processes due to faster mattress packaging with less energy consumption.

Application Description
Dispersion adhesives for film to print lamination
Highly refined folding boxes, book covers and other printing products set new standards in quality and appearance. Print finishers have a wide variety of possibilities for upgrading a product. One established and effective procedure is the film to print lamination of printed sheets with matt, glossy, structured, or special effects films. This results in enhanced printed surfaces of a superior quality. The quality of the lamination depends on several factors. The application method, the materials to be bonded, and the adhesive all have a decisive impact on the laminate quality and consequently also on the appearance and value of the entire print product. For many years, solvent-based adhesives were the product of choice for this application in the past. Increased requirements regarding the environmental compatibility of manufacturing processes and the recycling properties of the substances used imposed the need for a system change in the graphics industry. Alternative systems
that facilitate solvent-free laminating became absolutely necessary. In the last years, Jowat has developed and optimised a complete range of water-based adhesives for this application in close cooperation with engineering companies and print finishers.
Products from the Jowacoll
®
764.xx product group have been consistently optimised over the last years to improve their performance, for instance mechanical processing characteristics, cutting resistance, coating weight, gloss, and resistance to mechanical stress, e.g. due to embossing or fold burning. In addition, the new product generation also includes several adhesives that are approved for food contact. Which of the modern laminating adhesives is the best fit for an application depends on the machine type and the application method used, as well as on the specific requirements. However, the adhesive choice can also be influenced by what type of paper or film is to be bonded and by whether it has been printed conventionally or digitally.
The table below provides an overview of our dispersion adhesives from the product series Jowacoll
®
for laminating printed sheets. The product range comprises different product types with special performance characteristics adapted to the general process requirements in laminating applications.The products have been developed to meet the different requirements which arise from the production process as well as from the different carrier substrates and lamination materials. If the laminated compound is exposed to high mechanical stress during downline processing or if the films to be processed have a high rigidity (e.g. PET or acetate films), it is advisable to add 1.5 – 5 % of crosslinking agent Jowat
®
195.70 or 195.79 in the case of food packaging.

Noise insulation
Noise insulation
Bonding for effective sound and vibration absorption

Application Description
Product Information

Application Description
Background noise has a substantial effect on the quality of a car and the driving experience for passengers. Passenger cells in modern vehicles have to provide a silent environment and therefore need to be perfectly insulated from unwanted engine and road noise.
Self-adhesive insulating materials, like acoustic heavy-duty foils or vibration absorbing panels, are used to reduce the noise seeping into the cabin. These materials are bonded directly on the painted metal in concealed places behind the door panelling, on the body floor or in the trunk. Copolymer dispersions are odourless and characterised by good heat resistance as well as low VOC values and are the adhesives of choice in this application. Alternatively, the sound deadening materials may also be bonded with special PSA hot melts with minimal odour. Due to their vibration absorbing properties, these adhesives support the effectiveness of the insulating materials.
In addition, Jowat supplies suitable adhesives for bonding the clips and retainers necessary to attach sound insulation panels in the wheel housing to absorb splashing water and road noise or under the hood for sound insulation. Powerful PUR hot melts are highly resistant to all weathering conditions and are ideal for these application.

Baldų pramonė
Jokia kita pramonės sritis natspindi taip mūsų gyvenimo būdo kaip kad baldų pramonė. Esamas gyvenimo stilius atsispindi mūsų aplinkoje, kuri atskiria ribas ir kartu parodo jų susikirtimą bei susijungimą. Šiuolaikiniai baldai turi vis daugiau funkcionalumo kad patenkintų vienu metu vis įvairesnius poreikius. Ryšys tarp patogumo, malonumo gaminant maistą ir galimybė betarpiškai bendrauti su draugais: visa tai įmanoma sukuriant atskiras erdves patalpoje. Mūsų gyvenimo būdas yra tiesiogiai susijęs su tuo ką gali pasiūlyti baldų gamintojai, apstatant mūsų būstą. Jokia kita sritis nepajėgia apjungti įvairių tarpusavyje nesusijusių poreikių dizaino ir praktiškumo srityje: retro prabanga ir moderni elegancija, individualumas ir funkcionalumas, grįžimas į nostalgišką praeitį, visa tai galime apjungti.
Kad pavyktų pagaminti kokybiškus ir funkcionalius baldus, naudojamos įvairios medžiagos, kurios suteikia mūsų baldams ne tik nepriekaištingą išvaizdą, bet ir įgalina aukštą gamybos tempą bei kokybišką galutinį rezultatą. Todėl gamyboje yra naudojami aukštos klasės klijai, kurie viso gamybos proceso eigoje apjungia visus komponentus į vieną visumą.

Briaunos klijavimas
Siaurų medienos plokščių paviršių klijavimas įvairiomis briaunomis yra jau ilgametė praktika naudojama dešimtmečiais.  Kasmet auga reikalavimai gerai išvaizdai, tobulėja baldų gamybos įranga, taip pat auga naudojamų medžiagų įvairovė, ir visa tai kelia naujus iššūkius klijavimo technologijoms. Šiuolaikinėje aukštos klasės baldų gamyboje briaunos priklijavimo kokybė yra dažnai kaip viso baldo kokybinis ir vertybinis kriterijus. Galutinis vartotojas nori matyti kokybišką ir praktiškai nematomą baldo detalių klijų siūlę. .
Aukštos kokybės ir nepriekaištingos išvaizdos briaunos priklijavimui naudojami modernūs termoplastiniai į drėgmę reaguojantys klijai - lydalai. Klijams keliami įvairiapusiai reikalavimai nuo sukibimo su įvairiomis medžiagomis iki greito susiklijavimo proceso kad būtų galima atlikti sekančią gamybinę operaciją ir priklijuotos briaunos atsparumo karščiui bei ilgaamžiškumui. Reikalavimus išvaizdoje - "nulinė siūlė", aukštą atsparumą šilumai ir chemikalams geriausiai išpildo į drėgmę reaguojantys PUR klijai - lydalai, kurie tampa nepakeičiami virtuvės bei vonios baldų gamyboje. Naujausios kartos šiuos klijus - lydalus Jowat siūlo ir granulių pavidalu.  Pirmieji šių klijų naudotojai pastebėjo galimybę supaprastinto perėjimo į PUR technologiją. Kiekvienam briaunos klijavimo atvejui Jowat siūlo jau gatavą sprendimą.

Profilio apvilkimas
Šiuolaikiniai baldai ar vidaus interjero detalės yra neįsivaizduojami be apklijuotų įvairių profilių ir detalių. Apklijuotų plėvele (apvilktų) detalių sąrašas yra įspūdingas: tai yra įvairūs baldiniai profiliai, lubų, durų bei grindų apvadai, baldų stalčiai, plastikiniai langų profiliai, įvairios interjero detalės, nešančios konstrukcijos ir t.t.
Kaip laikantys profiliai (balkiai) naudojamos medžiagos iš medžio masyvo, klijuotos medienos, plastiko, aliuminio ir kitų metalų.
Kartu vystosi bei tobulėja ir klijų užtepimo įranga. Dabar vis labiau populiarėja klijų užtepimui platūs siauraplyšiai angaliai. Staklių pastūmos greitis taip pat kinta, moderniose mašinose jis pasiekė 100 m/min ribą.

Application Description
In the building technology, technical textiles also have to provide certain functions like tight seals, vapour barriers and absorbency of mechanical stress. The physical structural properties determine the ambient climate and can only be guaranteed by a secure compound of multiply textiles with suitable adhesives.Living comfort and energy efficiency play an increasing role in building projects. Building textiles can provide important functions in this regard: Roofing liners protect the roof against external influences, function as a water-repellent layer and facilitate a proper ventilation of the roofing truss. Vapour barriers don’t let anything go through and ensure that the requirements of the blower door test which measures the airtightness of buildings are met.
Jowat provides innovative adhesive solutions for different requirements: special adhesives with very high UV resistance for laminating roofing liners, pressure-sensitive hot melts for laminating nonwovens with diverse foils, reactive PUR hot melts with high bonding strength and low processing temperatures for bonding thin thermoplastic foils, as well as pressure-sensitive dispersions with high surface tack and very high cohesion for difficult to bond foils and textiles.
Roofing liners and vapour barriers
Wherever adhesives are used in the manufacture of technical textiles, Jowat is the right partner. We supply a comprehensive range of innovative products to our customers, meeting the respective demands which the technical textiles have to comply with in the building industry. For lamination and coating, several thermoplastic and reactive hot melt and waterbased dispersion adhesives are used successfully.
One major area of application where adhesives are used in the building sector is the manufacture of roofing liners. These technical textiles are mostly composed of a laminated multi-layer mix of diverse materials. Depending on the installation environment in the roof, a structure promoting superior vapour permeability or a vapour barrier may be chosen.
The bonded compound has to withstand mechanical stress, must be for instance resistant against perforation due to walking, and ensure high durability when exposed to UV light. In practice, the most suitable adhesives have proven to be the polyolefin-based (PO) adhesives for lamination of polypropylene (PP) foils and fleeces. Polyurethane (PUR) hot melt adhesives are the products of choice for superior compound strength and excellent resistance to mechanical stress.
For bonded composites of fleece with a more open textile structure, like protective films for painting operations, pressure-sensitive hot melts are well established. These are above all characterised by their excellent adhesion properties, since substrates that do not adhere well, e. g. Polyethylene (PE) foils, are often used in this area.
Construction measures in road and dike building are often undertaken with fleece that has a reinforcement backing of netting. High stress is absorbed by a stable plastic netting, the spacing between the layers is assured by the fleece. The manufacturing process often requires the use of dispersion adhesives to assemble these layers. A high solid content guarantees short evaporation times and high initial strength.

Application Description
Since the introduction of mechanical movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg and the invention of lithography by Alois Senefelder, books have become firmly established in society. Books are constant companions of students, diaries and photo books preserve the most precious and significant moments in life, and novels provide relaxation during quiet hours. Even the most advanced eBook readers cannot appeal to the readers’ senses as only a printed book does. As a partner to bookbinderies, Jowat supplies adhesives for numerous applications from the first to the last page, for industry and manual trades.
Jowat provides different adhesive solutions for the spine and side bonding of softcover books and catalogues and for all standard paper qualities. The spine glue for softcovers is adapted to the special requirements in manufacturing. Numerous factors have to be taken into account to ensure an ideal performance of the adhesive. For instance, the temperature of the adhesive, the dwell-time in the processing unit, the application amount and the feed speed. Side glues are used to bond the end sheets of a book or a magazine to the cover and the demands on these products are high as well. High flexibility, perfect adhesion on different surfaces, no bleed through, and maximum initial strength are essential for this application.
1. Spine glue
PUR / hot melts / dispersions / Two-Shot
After the book block has been milled on the back, the following step is to apply an adhesive film on the spine by nozzles or roller. For this process, several things must be considered to ensure a successful bonding result. Is the adhesive tank open? How high is the temperature? For how long will the adhesive remain molten? What application amount is needed and how high is the feed speed?
2. Side glue
Hot melts / dispersions / PUR
In general, the adhesive is applied by nozzle or roller on the first and on the last page of the book block, to bond it to the cover. The adhesive for this application has to be flexible, adhere to the most different surfaces and it should not bleed through, while providing maximum durability.

Application Description
In the assembly of furniture frames, powerful dispersion adhesives known as so-called “fast binders” due to their impressive short setting time are the product of choice for dowel and tenon joints of solid wood and wood-based parts. These adhesives are characterised by optimum viscosity, excellent processing properties and high bond strength, and ensure a high-quality and durable joint.

Application Description
Exterior doors provide access into a building and give a first, and ideally positive and lasting, impression. Beyond the superior appearance, modern doors are also expected to be permanently resistant to weathering. Aluminium doors, for instance, are usually powder-coated and provide an extremely durable and corrosion-resistant surface coupled with an attractive appearance. Those expectations can only be fulfilled if a high standard is ensured from the very beginning, in the manufacture of door leaves as well as of door frames.
Jowat supplies a powerful adhesive system which has been developed specially for laminating plastic or aluminium exterior doors with decorative foils: Tried and proven hot melt adhesives based on polyurethane (PUR) meet the high requirements regarding thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance necessary in exterior applications. In addition to excellent adhesion characteristics, a new generation of reactive hot melt adhesives also provides a shorter open time and higher green strength, and therefore facilitates faster lamination processes. Like in window profile wrapping applications, Jowat also supplies RAL-certified products for the manufacture of exterior doors.
