®
is easy to cut, handle and fit.
Facts CNAF Gaskets
Excellent sealing performance
CNAF materials are practically corrosion-free (no risk for corrosion of the flange surfaces
Temperature resistance from
-50 °C to 300 °C – depending mainly on gasket material composition, gasket thickness, medium, flange and bolt load conditions and special considerations.
KLINGER
®
PTFE gaskets
Our offer of soft sealing material based on PTFE guarantees maximum chemical resistance and is designed to satisfy most gasket applications. The products of KLINGER's superior chemical product range are tailored to provide the features required by the respective industries. Among others, this includes sealing even at low surface pressures, high resistance against strong acids or strong alkaline solutions, as well as good properties at medium and low temperatures.
Facts PTFE Gasket materials
Exceptional chemical resistance to strong acids and caustic substances
Designed to cater for the majority of gasket applications
No ageing of the material
KLINGER
®
Graphite gaskets
Graphite-based gaskets are suitable for temperatures between -200 °C and up to 550 °C, and offer resistance against a wide range of chemical products. Equipped with a non-stick finish developed specifically for this purpose, KLINGER's graphite-based gasket materials are easy to remove from the flange, even after exposure to high temperatures.
Facts Graphite gaskets
Highest-quality graphite foil
Suitable for temperatures between -200 °C and up to 550 °C
Big variety of different inserts available for all kinds of applications
Metallic gaskets
These gaskets, along with the older style jacketed gaskets are widely used in petrochemical applications. Metallic gaskets often utilize a soft sealing medium such as graphite in conjunction with the metal to create a high-strength, high-integrity gasket. This results in joints with very high leak-tightness.
KLINGER manufactures metallic gaskets in a wide range of alloys to cover even the most chemically aggressive applications.
Material Types
Spiral wound gaskets
Corrugated gaskets
Kammprofile gaskets
Ring type Joints
Facts Metallic Gaskets
Spiral wound gaskets: Ideal for use in applications where thermal cycling can be a problem
Kammprofile gaskets: combine the benefits of a soft material with the advantage of high integrity sealing of a metal gasket
Corrugated gaskets: particularly suitable for applications involving narrow flanges
Ring type joints: mainly used in offshore applications and certain styles can be adapted for subsea installation
Elastomere gaskets
Rubber-steel gaskets are employed wherever safe sealing of either conventional or special industrial media, either in the form of liquids or gases, is required. They are typically employed to ensure exceptionally low leak rates and are also the optimal solution in cases where operators have to work with low bolt loads and relatively low temperatures. The steel support ring prevents a blowout of the gasket and increases stability, allowing for easy handling, even when confronted with challenging fitting conditions.
KLINGER
®
KGS gaskets can be used in combination with all types of flange materials, ranging from plastic to steel, and are provided in a wide range of shapes and dimensions.. Amongst others, the product offering includes the EN 1514-1 as well as several sizes of the ANSI standard. KLINGER

KLINGER level gauges, originally invented by Richard Klinger more than 110 years ago, still serve to reliably indicate the liquid level in boilers and vessels today.
An efficient process operation demands high-performance measurement installations. KLINGER fluid monitoring products stand out from the competition as a result of their excellent mechanical strength and outstanding durability versus alkaline and acid solutions as well as boiler water. Furthermore, continuous quality checks permanently ensure best-in-class measurement performance, long-term stability and the resource-conserving properties that have made this product range “trusted. worldwide.”
Liquid level gauges feature a reflex glass within the body. An observation slot on the other side allows for clear reading of non-hazardous liquids. With regard to applications that involve either hazardous or toxic liquids or gases, operators around the world rely on KLINGER magnetic level gauges.

Manometer cocks
Manometer cocks feature a simple and compact design (only one moving part) which guarantees high operation safety and long durability. These robust shut-off cocks are specifically designed to meet an operator’s high measurement engineering requirements. KLINGER manometer cocks stand out due to their reliability and efficiency.
Facts Manometer Cocks
90° operation ensures immediate opening and closing procedure
Manual operation allows for throttling, thus enabling utilization in blow-down lines
No jamming as a result of corrosion
Transparent level gauges
In transparent level gauges the medium is contained within two glasses with smooth surfaces. The level of the medium level can easily be observed by looking through the glass. Thanks to resistance of the utilized materials, this level gauge is particularly suitable for use with aggressive media or steam. Protective mica shields can optionally be installed between the medium and the glass.
In order to improve visibility under special operating conditions, an illuminator can be mounted on one side of the transparent level gauge.
A105 and SS 316L are utilized as standard materials - alloy or other materials are available on demand.
Facts Transparent level gauges
Direct view of the fluid level
Direct vision through the glass (back illumination available)
Easy maintenance and very long service life
Suitable for steam media up to 120 bar and process media up to 250 bar
Reflex level gauges
Reflex level gauges allow the medium to be viewed through a reflex glass: The side of the glass exposed to the medium has a prismatic surface, while the other side is smooth. The medium level inside the level gauge is indicated by means of the light refraction principle, i.e.  the liquid-filled area completely absorbs the rays of light and appears dark, while the rays of light are fully reflected in the gas / air-filled area, which subsequently appears bright.
Reflex level gauges offer great advantages in terms of low purchase and maintenance costs as well as with regard to easy level reading. However, they cannot be used in certain cases, for example when the separation level between two liquids has to be read, when discerning the liquid color is required or when high-pressure water steam has to be measured.
A105 and SS 316L are utilized as standard materials - alloy or other materials are available on demand.
Facts Reflex level gauges
Direct view of the fluid level
More economic solution for fluid level checking
Different refraction behavior with liquid and gas (or steam)
Easy maintenance and very long service life
Suitable for steam media up to 32 bar and process media up to 400 bar
Bi-color level gauges
Bi-color level gauges are primarily used to measure high-pressure water steam. These gauges feature two flat transparent glasses, which are mounted at an angle to each other. Together with the gauge body, they form the chamber containing the medium.
A special red and green illuminator, which serves to create a double lighting system, is mounted on the rear side of the gauge body. In this context, red is used for steam and green for the liquid.
As standard material A105 is utilized.

With its certified trainings in accordance with EN 1591-4 (Flanges and their joints – Part 4: Qualification of personnel competency in the assembly of the bolted connections of critical service pressurized systems), KLINGER ensures that bolting technicians are able to apply tried and proven as well as certified know-how to their sealing tasks. Questions pertaining to storage, transport and handling are covered in the theoretical and practical training sessions, as are occupational safety topics, the importance of the correct torque and tools, interlocking elements as well as gasket removal and disassembly.
