Building Future Welders
Dedicated to building more than just welding products, Miller wants to help build people too.

Grants for Schools and Organizations
Gaining funding through grants as an alternative resource to support your welding-training projects and initiatives can be a great opportunity to expand your funds.

Sharing Stories that Matter
Behind every welding hood is a person we’d like to get to know. Why? Because the stories shared might inspire someone else to take a chance, try something different and begin a new chapter in their story.
Some of us have an unlikely path to becoming a welder — like Michael Brandt, owner of custom fabrication and mobile welding shop Garage Bound, LLC. At the age of 9, Michael had a great mentor who planted the seed for a love of welding. That love would help Michael get through some difficult times and later inspire him to pass on his passion to the next generation.

More about the Road Show...
Back in 1953, Niels Miller boarded a bus, added a display of welding equipment and took to the streets to call on customers. The rubber really hit the road in 1961, when the company launched its first decked-out semi truck, calling it “the biggest array of welders…ever displayed in a mobile unit.” The rest, they say, is history!
Fun Facts
The Miller Road Show has appeared in 48 states including Hawaii.  It has also been to Canada and Puerto Rico.

Hand and Body Protection
Overview
Welding Glove 101
Apparel 101
Jackets, gloves and apparel can be found in every welding facility, but not all products are created equal. Making sure your operators are wearing the best protection for the application is critical in not only reducing injuries and downtime, but also ensuring optimal performance. If the protection is comfortable, has a good fit and provides the necessary protection your welders will keep it on – increasing productivity and compliance.
Statistics & Trends
70%
70% of employees with hand injuries reported not wearing gloves at the time of the injury. The injuries of the remaining 30% were caused by inadequate, damaged or inappropriate gloves.
25%
More than 25% of all workplace accidents involve hand and finger injuries.
25%
Work-related burns account for 20-25% of all serious burns requiring hospital attention.
The Talk: Terms & Definitions
NFPA
– National Fire Protection Association, the world's leading advocate of fire prevention. The NFPA develops, publishes and distributes codes and standards intended to minimize the possibility and effects of fire and other risks.
ANSI
– American National Standard Institute, a nonprofit organization that defines and oversees common standards and assessment systems.
Kevlar® Thread
– Almost 2½ times stronger than nylon or polyester, with a heat decomposition (turns to ash) of 800º F. Does not melt.
Flame Retardant
– Materials that have been chemically treated to self-extinguish. Surface finishes and coatings are applied that inhibit, suppress or delay the production of flames.
Flame Resistance
– Materials that are inherently self-extinguishing and resistant to catching fire. They will not melt or drip when exposed directly to extreme heat, and protection is built into the fiber itself and can never be worn away or washed out.
Are You Covered?
OSHA Standard 1910.132
Employees exposed to the hazards created by welding, cutting, or brazing operations must be protected by PPE in accordance with the requirements of the general personal protective equipment standard. Appropriate protective clothing required for any welding will vary with the size, nature and location of the work to be performed.
ANSI Z49.11
- Requires all welders to wear protective flame-resistant gloves that provide the heat resistance and general hand protection needed for welding.
- Must be in good repair, dry and capable of providing protection from electric shock by the welding equipment.
- Insulating linings should be used to protect areas exposed to high radiant energy.
- Clothing and apparel must provide sufficient coverage and be made of suitable materials to minimize skin burns, ideally leather or flame resistant materials.
NFPA 51B, 5.1 Personal Protective Clothing
Clothing shall be selected to minimize the potential for ignition, burning, trapping hot sparks and electric shock.

Product Selection Guide
Help Me Choose the Right Product
Finding the equipment that's right for you doesn't have to be complicated.  Follow the steps below.
1. Select the right process
Welding Processes
The most common welding processes are Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW or Stick electrode), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW or MIG, a wire welding process), Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW, also a wire welding process) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW or TIG). The two most common cutting and gouging processes are Air Carbon Arc Gouging (CAC) and Air Plasma Arc Cutting (plasma).
Note that:
MIG and flux cored welding usually can be performed by the same machine (and sometimes pulsed MIG)
TIG machines can usually Stick weld (and vice versa)
Higher output Stick machines can also air carbon arc cut and gouge
A multiprocess welding machine might be able to perform all of these processes!

2. Evaluate Your Needs: Power and Portability
Input power
Does your machine need to be self-powered, or will AC power be available at the location where it’s primarily used?
For locations where an electrical hookup is not practical, consider a gas- or diesel-powered engine-driven welder/generator to supply welding and generator power.
For locations where AC power is available, you need to know its type—and whether it’s a match for the machine you’re considering:
Single-phase power
is found in most homes and garages. Check to see if the machine you’re considering requires single-phase power, and whether its voltage requirements (120 or 240 volts) are met by the electrical service at the intended location.
Three-phase power
is common in industrial settings. Check to see if the machine you’re considering requires three-phase power and whether its voltage requirements are met by the electrical service at the intended location.
About duty cycles
Duty cycle is an indication of how long a power source can continuously weld (at a specific amperage and voltage) in a 10-minute period of time before it needs to cool down. For example, a machine with a 60 percent duty cycle at 300 amps and 32 volts of welding output can be used (at 300 amps and 32 volts) for 6 minutes out of a 10-minute period. When comparing two similarsized power supplies it is important to pay close attention to both the amperage and voltage values that determine the rated load.
When considering duty cycle for a Stick machine, note that most Stick electrodes are consumed in less than two minutes. Further about 80% of all Stick welding is done with a 1/8-inch diameter electrode, which takes about one minute to consume.
To see if a machine meets your needs, consider the following power classifications.
Light Industrial products typically have a 20% duty cycle and a rated output of 230 amps or lower.
Industrial products typically have a 40-60% duty cycle and a rated output of 300 amps or lower.
Heavy Industrial products typically have a 60-100% duty cycle and a rated output of at least 300 amps.
Generator power
Out in the field, you may need an engine-driven welder/generator to supply 120- or 240-volt AC power to run tools and lights, or supply 12-volt DC power to charge automotive batteries and jump-start vehicles. Miller welder/generators are packed with power; larger units even offer option packages that add 10 to 20 kW of generator power.
Learn more about generator power requirements >>
Portability
Can you bring the work to the machine, or does the machine need to go to the work? Check the product detail pages for types of portability:
Shoulder strap, handles, running gear, carts, etc.
Many engine-driven welding generators fit in the back of a pickup truck, enabling them to be driven to wherever the welding is needed. Heavy-duty trailers are also available for engine drives.

SubArc Digital Series
Our SubArc Digital Series offers both DC and AC/DC capabilities.  DC Digital models are rated for 650 – 1000 Amp; and AC/DC Digital models are rated for 1000 amps at 100% duty cycle.
The power sources have the capacity to handle Submerged Arc (SAW) and Electroslag (ESW) welding applications, from traditional DC single-arc to multi-wire tandem welding. In the case of ESW welding or other high-current demand, two or more power sources can easily be paralleled.
In addition to these power source options, the series offers two interface controls — analog and digital — and a range of wire drive motors and accessories, including single- and twin-wire torches,  and external cladding heads. The accessories are powered with a safe, low control- voltage (24 VAC) from the power source.

Miller Cares About Your Safety!
To help you stay accident free, we are giving you a wide variety of safety guidelines and resources. These guidelines are based on AWS, ANSI, NEMA, NFPA, and many other organizations that have your best interests in mind.
How does a pro use his tools? Safely and carefully - by the book - every day! Use these resources to join the ranks of professional welders whose lives depend on the safe handling and use of welding and cutting equipment every working day! Your family will be glad you did.
Safety Precautions
These safety precautions contain the basic information needed to install, operate, maintain, and repair our equipment. They are short, direct, clear, and simple. These precautions are the backbone of every Owner's Manual we produce. They cover most hazards you may encounter and explain briefly how to avoid them. Included at the end of each is a list of safety references so you can find more complete information if you need it.
