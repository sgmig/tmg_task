What BriskHeat Customers Are Saying
“In 2004 Brisk Heat supplied us with silicone heating pads and controllers for one of our industrial blenders (used to create flavoring mixtures for many popular food products). They are still running strong in 2020! We are putting in another line with a blender that will have the same heating requirements. We will use a BriskHeat system. ”
Kevin Knapp
(V.P. Plant Operations)
“I have been purchasing BriskHeat products for several years to meet our company’s heat tracing needs. They specify the necessary products to meet my particular need, whether it’s a heating pad application to keep our equipment hot, a heat trace application to keep fat from setting up in the supply lines, or for freeze protection for our hot water recirculation system. These items have always worked as promised and I can get them quickly, with the items generally being in stock.
BriskHeat is the first place I call when I have a need for any type of heat tracing.
”
Bret Marquis
(Project Engineer with Pro-Pet LLC)
“Right from the start, I was impressed with BriskHeat. They are a company with exceptional customer service. We order materials and they arrive on time. If we ever have any questions, there is always someone on the other end of the line who can answer them for us immediately.
BriskHeat offers us a well-made high-quality product
that does the job perfectly. This is the type of partner relationship we strive to develop to ensure our customers receive the best final product we can produce.”
Robert Ferguson
(Project Manager with International Flora Technologies)
“I have been working in R&D for over a decade. Not only do we require accuracy and reliability, but we need precision and reproducibility as well. BriskHeat products give us all of this. Their wide range of heat products, in addition to the monitors and controllers for those products, provide us with unparalleled control of our processes. I would highly recommend BriskHeat and their expertise.!”
Marc Oddo
(Senior Engineer Nutrien)
“We have installed tens of thousands of feet of BriskHeat’s self-limiting electric heat trace cable all over the country, in every climate imaginable. BriskHeat’s product has never let us down, not one failure!”
Todd Goldsmith
(Chief Operating Officer with Liquid Systems)

BriskHeat's flexible surface heaters and temperature controls are used across nearly every industry to increase productivity, reduce downtime, and lower maintenance costs.
Freeze Protection
Cold temperatures can often damage or destroy objects and their contents.  Pipes, valves, tanks, vessels, conveyers, and housings are examples of common objects that can be hurt by the cold.  BriskHeat flexible surface heating products wrap around these items to protect them in even the most extreme conditions.
Learn more
Process Temperature Control and Maintenance
You may have a process that requires an elevated temperature.  This simply means that you have an operation of some sort that requires maintaining a temperature of an object within a given range.  To ensure successful results in all types of processes, consult BriskHeat for the proper surface heating product for your application.
Learn more
Flow Viscosity Control
Many liquids flow easier when they are heated.  Common examples include motor oil, honey, tar, syrup, melted plastic, sulfuric acid, molten glass, and food-processing oils.  BriskHeat’s flexible surface heating products will heat these items, without direct-contact scorching or contamination, to lower viscosity and increase flow.
Learn more
Condensation Prevention
When the ambient temperature outside an object is lower than the surface temperature of the object, condensation can form on the inside or outside of the surface.  This can lead to undesirable dripping and potential area-contamination. BriskHeat’s products will create a temperature equilibrium, eliminating condensation problems.

Minimizing Heat Loss in Process Heating Applications
Minimizing Heat Loss in Process Heating Applications
November 2, 2020 10:34:00 AM EST by
BriskHeat
Process heating can be a critical factor in manufacturing and can contribute to the overall cost of operation. Insulation is an important factor in minimizing heat loss. Often, this is not considered during the design phase. After construction, adding, or increasing insulation thickness may be difficult. Using a less efficient heating system is like throwing energy dollars out the window. Insufficient insulation can jeopardize worker safety as well as product quality. It can also lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and damage to temperature sensitive equipment.
The key to energy efficient heating systems includes:
►
Knowledge of your heating requirements
►
Examining potential sources of heat loss
►
Selection of insulating material
►
Separate or integrated heating
►
Proper installation techniques
Determining Heating Requirements
Process, Industrial or Application Engineers will typically outline a flow diagram to describe the process requirements. Equipment specific to the manufacturing process is planned along with any material handling requirements to move material from one area to another. When the process requires heating material, calculations are made to consider:
►
the lowest temperature for material introduced
►
the desired temperature increase during that stage
►
how quickly the temperature must rise
►
environmental conditions around the equipment.
All this factors into determining the amount and location of required heating.
Sources of Heat Loss
Any time heat is transferred to a mass other than as intended, it is considered heat loss. Heat loss can result from:
►
Conduction - the transfer of heat from a hot mass to a mass that is colder. If a pipe is hot and heat transfers to a pipe stand or bracket, it is lost rather than all heat transferring to the product within the pipe.
►
Convection - the result of heat from a hot object moving to a cooler area like hot air leaking to atmosphere from an opening in a furnace wall.
►
Radiation - the transfer of electromagnetic energy through space.
►
Evaporation - additional energy is required to evaporate condensate during cooling, or as part of a chemical reaction.
A major source of heat loss is poor insulating practice. This can be insufficient thickness, but more often, is the result of damaged insulation. Important items to look for during insulation inspection are:
►
Tears in the outer covering
►
Damaged or missing lagging
►
Loose insulation on the floor
►
Discoloration of insulation or outer coverings
►
Exposed surfaces
►
Areas of increased temperature identified by thermal images
In some cases, further investigation (e.g. remove coverings or the insulation) is needed to identify the underlying problem.
Insulating Material Selection
Material selection is a critical component to energy efficiency. Different materials and thicknesses impact efficiency by reducing heat loss. Application temperature, installation, environment, and durability are vital considerations. All these materials can be applied directly over piping or flow control components and some can be used in formed insulators with covering material. Fiberglass, Aerogel, polyimide fiber, and silicone sponge can be used in all-in-one heated insulating jackets.
Heating jackets are insulators with built-in heating wire which may include covers of different materials. Covers are used to prevent UV degradation, unintentional damage, moisture permeation or environmental wear of the insulation. If the insulation will be removed and reinstalled in the same location, chosen insulation should be durable and easy to handle.
Fiberglass mat
can be cut and wrapped around pipe, components, or vessels. Fiberglass has a low thermal conductivity and is suitable for high temperature applications but requires an outer layer.
A fiberglass insulating jacket is made by sandwiching insulation between two pieces of material selected specifically for the application. Outdoor applications require moisture resistant fabrics to prevent water or other liquids from saturating the insulation and decreasing performance (reduced R-Value). The jacket may also protect the insulation from abrasion, or unintentional tearing.
Calcium Silicate
(Cal-Sil) is made from limestone and diatomaceous earth. The material is molded into required shapes for pipes, fittings, components, or flat sheets. It has high compressive strength, is abuse resistant, and some variations are water resistant. It has a low thermal conductivity value; however, installation may be time-consuming.
Mineral Wool
is made by spinning the fibers of molten minerals including slag and ceramics. It can be shaped and stiffened by adding binding materials. Thermal conductivity is lower than fiberglass and density is higher. The higher density means it is much less likely to fold or slump. fittings, components, or flat sheets. It has high compressive strength, is abuse resistant, and some variations are water resistant. It has a low thermal conductivity value; however, installation may be time-consuming.
Silica Aerogel
works well in many industrial applications because it has very low thermal conductivity and a rofile up to 75% thinner than competing materials. The material is moderately durable and, can be removed and reused. Important properties include hydrophobicity, meaning resistant to moisture. Moisture can cause corrosion on surfaces under the insulation which may not be noticed under casual inspection.
Polyimide Fiber
is a light weight, reinforced insulating blanket with low thermal conductivity and more durable than fiberglass. It is resistant to acids, hydrocarbons, and most solvents. It is drapable, for easy installation and can be used as insulation in component jackets.
Silicone sponge
can be manufactured in different ways that impact the overall performance; however, application temperatures are lower, and it often lacks resistance to wear. A silicone jacket may be placed on the outside of the sponge to increase durability. The cost of silicone sponge is often higher than fiberglass. Elastomeric foam is lower cost compared to silicone sponge; however, has a lower temperature rating, 250°F (120°C). Tubular foam is flexible, even at colder temperatures, and used in industrial and residential applications. This material is well suited for freeze protection, insulation of hot water pipes, and condensation protection.
Cloth heating jackets combine form-fitting insulation and the heat required for a process requiring heat. These can be custom engineered for piping, flow-control components and vessels. Things to consider are:
►
Can a heating tape, cable or blanket be placed around the components to maintain good surface contact and uniformity?
►
Will insulation need to be removed for maintenance and how time consuming is the process?
Valves, pumps, flow meters, flanges, strainers and other flow components pose special challenges. Their complex shapes and variable masses make it especially important to properly heat and insulate as much surface area as possible. If a 4” gate valve has hot gas flowing through it, the valve will quickly lose heat due to the mass of the valve body, which acts like a heat sink. The exposed surfaces of the valve present more area for heat dissipation, and direct contact with a heater is more difficult. A custom cloth heating jacket (Figure 6) caninclude the heating wire, insulation, sensor and controller for maximum efficiency.
Vacuum chambers can be another challenge for heating and reducing heat loss. The vacuum chamber jacket (Figure 7) requires both heat and insulation. Applying heat with individual tapes and maintaining uniformity would be difficult. Sewing heaters into the jacket greatly increases temperature uniformity, eliminates potential gaps and greatly decreases installation time. Figure 8 shows how heaters can be incorporated to achieve better performance.
Insulation Thickness
After determining which types of material may be suitable, it is necessary to determine insulation thickness based on the application. The thicker the material layer, the less the heat loss. Insulations are available in different densities which will impact the thermal conductivity. To determine the thickness, consider required surface temperature. If the temperature exceeds 140°F (60°C), it may be necessary to add protective guards to maintain a safe working environment. The cost of guards versus the cost of thicker insulation should be weighed, and physical barriers that may prevent access for maintenance should be considered.
Proper Installation Techniques
Proper heater and insulator installation is critical to not only energy efficiency, but quality of the material flowing through the system. Regardless if it is fuel gas, heating oil, steam, or honey, the process has special requirements for the exiting fluids. The proper fit and positioning is critical to meeting this requirement.
Self-regulating cable, flexible heating tapes, heat-trace cable, and Mineral Insulated (MI) cable are potential options for component heating. Select a heater with required wattage and coverage area based on heat losses for insulation to be used and follow the manufacturer’s installation instruction. These can be cost effective “off the shelf” solutions for heating simple shapes where they are able to provide good surface coverage as required to heat and maintain temperature.
Insulation should fit securely, and not allow gaps where heat may escape. It should not be the means to secure the heater in place. Cloth jackets have various fastener types and are designed for easy removal and reuse. The jackets are engineered to match the component’s dimensions. A tight and secure fit ensures the temperature sensor and heating wires are in direct contact with the component. All pipe, fittings and components should be insulated, leaving no gaps between insulators.
Conclusion
Heat loss can be a major concern for all companies, not just manufacturers; however, heat loss can be reduced by careful system design and inspection. Utilizing the tips presented here will help reduce heat loss, increasing system efficiency and saving money. Insulation selection and proper installation are key factors in system design and require careful consideration. A qualified heating company can be consulted for application support.

Ampere (Amp)
-
Unit of current (flow) (l)=E/R
AC -
Alternating current.
Ampacity -
The current-carrying capacity of the conductor under stated thermal conditions.*
Conductor -
A conductor is the current-carrying, non-heat producing component of a heating element.*
Conduction -
The transfer of energy within or between two bodies in physical contact.
Convection -
The movement of a mass with its associated energy (liquid or gas) from one location to another.
DC -
Direct Current.
Dielectric Breakdown -
The ability of the electrical insulation to withstand an applied voltage
Element -
An element is a resistor encased in an acceptable insulating material covered with a protective sheath.
Ground -
A conducting connection between an electrical circuit or equipment and the earth or some conducting body that serves in place of the earth.*
Hazardous Location -
Locations are classified depending on the properties of the flammable vapors, or gases, or combustible dusts, or fibers which may be present and the likelihood that a flammable or combustible concentration or quantity is present.*
Heat -
Heat is energy in transition, or transfer, from one body to another by virtue of temperature difference existing between the bodies.
Heater -
A heater is a completed, usable assembly containing one or more elements.
Heat of Fusion -
Heat necessary to change solid to liquid.
Heat of Vaporization -
Heat necessary to change solid to gas.
Hertz -
Unit of frequency of charge reversal for alternating current.
Hi-Pot -
A high voltage quality assurance test performed on electrical components and systems.
Impedance Heat -
A system in which heat is generated in a pipeline or vessel wall by causing current to flow through the pipeline or vessel wall by direct connection to an AC voltage source from a dual-winding transformer.
Insulation -
Electrical insulation is the dielectric material surrounding the resistor and/or conductor in order to electrically isolate the current-carrying components from ground or other components.* Thermal insulation is any material that retards the transfer of heat to the environment or other components.
Insulation Resistance -
Insulation resistance is the ability of the insulation to resist the percentage of current.*
Leakage -
The undesirable passage of current flow through or over the surface of an Insulator.
Leakage Current -
The total electrical current flow from the resistor through or around the insulation to a point external to the resistor when
the element is energized.*
OHM -
The electrical unit of resistance (R) R=E/I
Parallel Circuit -
A circuit in which the identical voltage is presented to all components and the components according to the resistance or the impedance of components.
Radiation -
The transfer of energy from one body to another through space by electromagnetic wave phenomena.
Rating -
Rating is the performance characteristic of an element or heater and is normally expressed in power output (watts) for a specific input voltage.
Resistor -
A resistor is the heat-producing component of an element.*
Series Circuit -
A circuit in which the components are arranged end to end to form a single path for current.
Single Phase -
A system energized from a single alternating voltage.
Specific Heat -
The heat energy in Btu's required to change the temperature of one pound of a substance by 1°F.
Specific Gravity (Gas) -
The ratio of the density of a gas to the density of water at 60°F and 14.7 PSIA.
Specific Gravity (Liquid) -
The ratio of the density of a liquid to the density of water at 60°F and 14.7 PSIA.
Thermal Resistance -
The property that opposes the flow of heat (energy) through the material.
Terminal -
A terminal is the device or point at which external power is connected.*
Three Phase -
A system energized from three substantially equal voltages that differ in phase by one-third cycle or 120°.
Voltage (Volt) -
Unit of electrical pressure. 1 volt is the amount of pressure that cause one ampere of current under a pressure of one volt. (W) W=EI
Wattage (Watt) -
Unit of electrical power. One watt is equivalent to the power represented by one ampere of current under a pressure of one volt.
Watt Density -
Watt density is the output of the element or the resistor in watts per square inch of surface. On heating cable elements, watt density is expressed in watts per foot of cable.*
Wattage Rating Tolerance -
Wattage output tolerance is the acceptable manufacturer's wattage variation allowed from rated wattage at rated voltage.*
*NEMA Standard
