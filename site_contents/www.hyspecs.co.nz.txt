This email is to show our appreciation for the Hyspecs after hours service we experienced over Easter weekend...
Hydralada had an urgent call out for a Poclain wheel motor failure on Sunday night and had to have the machine running again by the next day (Easter Monday).  Mark Featherstone took the afterhours call on Sunday night, he indentified the parts and had them ready for collection in under 2 hours. Although this service is necessary it also is rewarding to experience in reality." - From the team at Hydralada.

Wairau Stream Pedestrian Bridge
Hyspecs worked with local construction companies and Auckland City Council to provide the hydraulics for the lifting bridge.
Contact Hyspecs
The bridge is raised and lowered on demand when boats leave or enter the marina.
The bridge is unmanned so reliability and safety is critical. We designed and manufactured the hydraulic powerunit, valve blocks and cylinders at our Auckland branch. The interconnecting tube and hose ends were all stainless steel and installed over a week by our on-site service team.
Commissioning was completed during peak summer season with minimum disruption to boat traffic. The bridge has been well received by locals.
Watch a video of the bridge working below.

Pukekohe Wastewater Upgrade
As part of the Pukekohe Wastewater upgrade Hyspecs supplied hydraulic powerunits, local control panels and interconnecting pipework to three sets of pinch valve trains.
Contact Us
The powerunits were manufactured from 316 stainless steel and designed for a 20 year lifespan. They incorporate hydraulic accumulators for emergency closing of the pinch valves, in the unlikely event of total power or communications failure.
The powerunits and electrical panels were designed by Hyspecs in Solidworks and sent to the client for approval before manufacturing.
The electrical control panels incorporated the motor starters, PLC, battery backup and touch screen display on the door. The graphics display indicated valve positions, alarms, operating modes etc and was programmed by our Control Systems Engineer.
On site installation, pressure testing, flushing and commissioning was completed by our service department.

Film Industry Hydraulics
Hyspecs has been contracted by a number of special effects companies to supply hydraulics for their motion bases and other dynamic motion rigs.
Contact Hyspecs
The motion bases typically use servo performance valves and large accumulators to achieve high speed motion with very accurate control. These are typically big budget movies filmed at the Auckland or Wellington production studios. Hyspecs has also supplied more “off the shelf” hydraulics for smaller special effects rigs.
