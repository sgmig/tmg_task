Capturing the Opportunity in Electrification
Capturing the opportunity in electrification
Ahlstrom-Munksjö has successfully served the automotive industry for 50 years and has gained a leading position in engine filtration worldwide. As electrification is rapidly changing the industry landscape, Ahlstrom-Munksjö is closely following the market development and innovating fiber-based solutions for energy storage applications.
Demand for energy storage is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by vehicle electrification, a shift towards renewable energy, increasing demand in stationary applications, and effective electricity supply chain management.
In Europe, the European Union is driving the delivery of greener vehicles and mobility system solutions through Europe Green Vehicles Initiative (EGVI), a  Public-Private Partnership (cPPP). EGVI cPPP brings together European Green Vehicles Initiative Association (EGVIA) and the European Commission services. Covering all vehicles from passenger cars, trucks, and buses to two-wheelers and new vehicles concept, the EGVI cPPP aims to decrease CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050.
Storage and security of supply
To keep a balance between the supply and demand of electricity, energy needs to be saved in large amounts ranging from just a few seconds to longer periods such as days to stabilize fluctuations in demand and supply. By storing energy, we can also improve efficiency and integrate more renewable energy sources into our grids. This could also make supply more secure and lower costs to consumers.
Batteries are key devices in storing energy and thus crucial enablers to reduce carbon dioxide emission. Therefore global demand for batteries is expected to grow very rapidly over the coming years, making the batteries market segment a strategic pillar of the global energy market.
Ahlstrom-Munksjö solutions for energy storage
Fiber-based materials are widely used in energy storage devices, and thanks to the Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s extensive expertise in cellulose, microglass and specialty nonwoven materials, the company is developing a complete range of solutions for our customers.
In 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö introduced the FortiCell® product platform of fiber-based energy storage solutions. The first product launch included a complete range of solutions for lead-acid batteries, and we are aiming to introduce an offering for lithium-ion batteries with better temperature resistance and improved safety aspects in the future. Stay tuned for more electrifying news!

Imagine fiber
Fibers are one of the wonders of nature forming the structural components of all that’s green. Modern technology has allowed the man to harness the strength, durability and versatility of fibers and put them to work in everyday products and applications. New fibers have been created from materials like glass and carbon pushing the boundaries even further.
Fiber is the common material throughout our broad portfolio of products worldwide, whether natural or synthetic fiber. And we are the experts in transforming this fiber into advanced materials and solutions.
Our role is to advance the capabilities of fiber-based materials to develop and innovate applications, solutions and end-user experiences, striving to rethink the role fiber has in our society.
We believe that what we have only seen the beginning of what fiber-based materials and solutions can be used for. From our point of view, the potential and future of fiber are endless: our imagination and capacity to innovate are the only ones to define the limits.
We want to be challenged to develop innovative and customized solutions from fiber.
When we imagine the future, we
