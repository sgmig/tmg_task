DIE CUTTING
Our process can be set to die-cut the following materials: tape, adhesive, foam, sponge, silicone foam, mesh, fabric, thin steel, plastic, film and rubber.
SLITTING
Aerchs offers optimized material utilization, accurate accuracy, and imaginable repeating of various types of cutting work. We have the ability to slit and rewind materials into a variety of rolls in accordance with custom widths and lengths. Cutting performance includes:
LAMINATING
Most of the customers require the lamination of two or more materials. The most common practice is to add a pressure sensitive adhesive to a substrate such as a sponge, foam, rubber, or film.
LASER CUTTING
Our laser cutting is especially good for small and complex parts, and it is a good choice for lasers that are difficult to cut.

Product Description
Kingzom-MS
nano micro suction tape
is developed for use as the non-slip temporary fixation material, cushion foam used for the stationery and electrical appliances, as well as various other general-purpose applications.
Micro suction tape micro suction side without glue but is easy to stick and tear repeatedly, back side is ordinary adhesive for fixing on base surface, it can be used for many kinds of mobile usages which require repeatedly stick-and-tear cycles. Compared with the magnet, nano micro suction tape can avoid magnetic damage to electronic products.
Kingzom can provide both standard and custom size shape for a customer depending on their needs.
Basically, the suction force is the same regardless of the thickness and the color. The thicker type has excellent cushioning characteristics due to the flexibility of the foam. The thinner type is aesthetic and useful for a narrow gap.
Structure
Features
The micro-suction side is easy to stick and tear repeatedly.
If the micro-suction side becomes dirty, wipe the surface with a wet tissue and the surface becomes reusable as before.

Product Description
Kingzom-MS
nano micro suction tape
is developed for use as the non-slip temporary fixation material, cushion foam used for the stationery and electrical appliances, as well as various other general-purpose applications.
Micro suction tape micro suction side without glue but is easy to stick and tear repeatedly, back side is ordinary adhesive for fixing on base surface. It is widely used for many kinds of mobile usages which require repeatedly stick-and-tear cycles, such as phone holder, case and smooth surface etc
There are two colours white (0.8, 0.5mm thickness) and black (0.8, 0.5, 0.3mm). Basically, the suction force is the same regardless of the thickness and the color. The thicker type has excellent cushioning characteristics due to the flexibility of the foam. The thinner type is aesthetic and useful for a narrow gap. Kingzom can provide both standard and custom size for a customer depending on their needs.

Laser and waterjet cutting
Laser and waterjet cutting
Laser
Our laser cutting is especially good for small and complex parts, and it is a good choice for lasers that are difficult to cut. If you are in the design phase of the project, laser cutting can provide samples quickly and without increasing mold costs. The roll-to-roll process is suitable for applications where accuracy is critical.
Laser ablation is a process in which a hard surface portion of a material is removed by laser beam irradiation. ITO and other sputtered films can also be laser ablated.
Waterjet cutting
The water flow cutting is suitable for thick materials such as foam which often have face depressions during die cutting. Products cut with water jets have a very smooth and smooth cut surface. Water jets are well applied to samples, thick, large, heat-resistant materials such as silicones and some complex designs that require no errors.
