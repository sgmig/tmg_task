Bostik, an Arkema company
Bostik is the Adhesive solutions business line of Arkema group.  Building on its unique set of expertise in materials science, Arkema offers  a portfolio of first-class technologies to address ever-growing demand for new and sustainable materials. With the ambition to become in 2024 a pure player in Specialty Materials, the Group is structured into 3 complementary, resilient and highly innovative segments dedicated to Specialty Materials - Adhesive solutions, Advanced Materials, and Coating Solutions - accounting for some 80% of Group sales, and a well-positioned and competitive Intermediates segment.
Arkema offers cutting-edge technological solutions to meet the challenges of, inter alia, new energies, access to water, recycling, urbanization and mobility, and fosters a permanent dialogue with all its stakeholders. The Group reported sales of €8.7 billion in 2019, and operates in some 55 countries with 20,500 employees worldwide.
A global leader in adhesive technologies
Bostik is one of the largest adhesive and sealant companies. Worldwide, we employ some 5,000 people in 50 countries across five continents. Our customers come from diverse markets, most notably the industrial manufacturing, construction and consumer sectors.
We develop smart sealing & bonding solutions for today and tomorrow
We carefully watch market trends and relentlessly work at putting in place pioneering and sustainable solutions around 6 R&D platforms.
Bostik contributes to and benefits from Arkema’s know-how in specialty materials
Smart innovation
Our smart identity is underpinned by innovation.
We pursue innovation vigorously, applying the latest technological advances to developing ‘smart’ adhesives. Our archives are laden with examples of Bostik technologies that have disrupted markets - from potato starch-based wallpaper paste to elastic attachment adhesive for diapers.
Today, our commitment to innovation is as strong as ever. We innovate with our customers through a global R&D network, comprising three international Smart Technology Centers and 11 regional centers. And we differentiate our business through this investment. That’s why in 2014, 15% of Bostik sales came from products launched in the previous three years.

Craft Glue
At Bostik, we’re committed to using our technological and chemical expertise to improve everyday applications through our range of consumer adhesives.
Many of our craft glue products are familiar, household names. To this day, many of our customers and clients are surprised that some of our most sophisticated, market-leading chemical innovations are present in their child’s scrap book.
Our craft glue range brings with it a great deal of versatility. From office supplies, general arts and crafts, to spray adhesives, our smart craft glue technologies are unparalleled in their effectiveness.
Adhesives for consumers: applications
Our craft glues are perfect for art and craft lovers of all ages. From card and collage making for school projects, to devising performance and flow charts for your office space, our soft adhesives are easy to use, easy to clean, and contain no solvents acid.
Whether you want to mix it with powder paints for finger painting, or water it down to make papier-mâché, Bostik glue is an ideal tool for family fun, and has been designed to meet and exceed the most stringent legislation relating to child safety.
For more practical and precise adhesive solutions, our globally-recognized Blu Tack allows for safe, clean and economical use while providing an ideal adhesive solution for mounting particularly small, delicate or oddly-shaped items.
Its ability to change states when pulled or rolled by hand has made Blu Tack the subject of worldwide renown. Whether you use it to stick posters to your bedroom wall, clean fluff and dust from your laptop keyboard, or mold it into fun shapes, Blu Tack is an essential domestic product.
As well as providing soft adhesive solutions for your home, we also provide unique methods for applying them. In addition to manufacturing glue sticks for dry application, we stock repositionable spray adhesives for fast-setting, stainless bonds over large areas, and craft glue guns – useful for craft or floristry work that requires adhesion to delicate substrates.

Adult care: smart adhesive solutions for the disposable hygiene industry
Adult incontinence is the fastest growing segment within the global hygiene market. As the aging population expands so does its willingness to use incontinence products. This means increased demand for better absorption, thinner cores, and a more satisfying fit, greater comfort and discretion. Bostik’s ability to identify emerging trends means we stay in front of our competitors in introducing new solutions to enable you to meet these challenges. From the ability to use the latest apertured top sheets to maintaining integrity in thinner cores, our ever-evolving suite of smart adhesive solutions gives you the flexibility to move quickly and successfully when the changing market requires it.
If you are starting a new project or need innovative solutions to enhance your current product, your first step should be to contact Bostik.
Smart applications for adult care
Elastic attachment.
For living life to the fullest, smart adhesives help your products stand up to the action. Uniquely formulated to give you strong shear and stress with whatever substrates and processes you choose to use. That means it is the only adhesive you need for all your elastic bonding applications.
Construction.
Smart enough to create a strong bond even between dissimilar substrates. Adaptable enough to provide the performance you need regardless of line speed or product design. And don’t forget the benefits of less blocking, no bleed through and reduced odour.
Stretch.
Stretch again, again, again... keeps performing and keeps its shape. Smart and flexible in every sense. Smart enough to enable your product to discretely maintain its shape and keep your customers dry and comfortable. Flexible enabling the use of a wider variety and softer materials.
Wetness indicator.
Enable caregivers to know exactly when it is time to make a change. Smart indicators help your products keep skin dry and healthy by reliably and clearly changing colour. Colour change reliability remains consistent regardless of temperature swings and even harsh shipping and storage environments.

Feminine care: smart adhesive solutions for the disposable hygiene industry
Even before we introduced the first high-performance pad attachment adhesive for feminine hygiene
products
, Bostik was recognised as a leading collaborative partner for manufacturers worldwide. Today, we offer a wide range of smart adhesives for feminine hygiene products. Our cost-effective solutions help meet your production needs and the in-use needs of your consumer wherever you or she is in the world. Our adhesives are also designed to help you provide her with a product that is reliable, discreet, secure, comfortable, and absorbent.
If you are starting a
new project or need innovative solutions
to enhance your current ones, your first step should be to contact Bostik.
Smart applications for pad positioning and construction
Pad attachment.
Our smart attachment adhesives enable you to produce a pad that sticks consistently, stays in place, and does not rip or leave adhesive residue on removal. They also adapt and adhere to most fabric topographies, e.g. weaves, surface treatments, and elongations. Advanced processability creates more consistent performance across add-on and temperature ranges.
Construction.
Our innovative construction adhesive formulations are designed for excellent processability and cost optimisation. In particular, we can support the use of lower-cost substrates and other materials used in absorbent sanitary pads. Our goal: To meet your production needs while still allowing you to satisfy the needs of your consumer.
Your partner in choosing the right feminine hygiene adhesive
For decades we have been an industry leader in creating pad fastening adhesives. As consumer needs in an ever-changing global market shift, we’re flipping the way you and your product users look at adhesive performance. From innovation and the development of new adhesive technology to Bostik’s improved method for testing product satisfaction during use, let’s work together to meet and exceed consumer expectations.

The smart choice for thermal efficiency
Insulated Glass
Sealants
Bostik is one of the longest established companies in the Insulating Glass industry, boasting a 35+ year track record of quality and reliability. Our smart solutions fully comply with both the US/Canadian standard ASTM E2190 and the European standard EN 1279 Parts 2, 3, 4 & 6.

Energy efficiency matters
Improving thermal efficiency allows not only for a more comfortable environment, but also to reduce the energy necessary to keep a building warm.
Windows are one of the most significant areas of a building where warmth is lost.  An average house can lose up to 30% of its heat through poorly insulated windows.
Leading-edge hot melt sealant technology
With over 35 years of experience in the manufacture of insulating glass sealants, Bostik has grown to become a market leader with:
Unparalleled product performance and processability
Comprehensive product line including primary and secondary sealants
Dedicated R&D team and expert technical support focused on product innovation
Commitment to helping customers with continuous improvement to optimize product performance
Smart sealants for insulating glass units
How sealants contribute to the overall performance of insulating glass units:
Thermal efficiency:
the gas retention and warm edge effect of the sealants determine energy ratings
Barrier properties:
sealants keep moisture out to prolong the service lifespan of insulating glass units
Processability:
choose the right technology, as some require mixing, purging and curing times
Safety:
avoid harmful substances for a safer home and workplace

Our History

The Boston Blacking Company: A great beginning
In 1889, the Boston Blacking Company, a producer of leather colourings and dyes for the shoemaking industry, was founded in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The company grew in several countries through mergers, acquisitions and organic growth. By the late 1920’s, the Boston Blacking Company was established in 12 countries across three continents and employed over 1,000 chemists and technicians. A number of products has been launched under the Bostik brand as early as the 1940’s and took on the Bostik company name in the 1960’s.
Growth through acquisition
In 1980, Bostik was taken over by the Connecticut group Emhart Corporation, which nine years later was, itself, bought up by Black & Decker. Black & Decker split apart the mechanical and chemical activities of the group to leave Bostik as a stand-alone concern.
In 1990, the French oil and gas group Total acquired Bostik and merged its own adhesive affiliates into it.
TotalFina and Elf Aquitaine merged to form TotalFinaElf, subsequently renamed Total.  Their respective adhesives divisions, Bostik and Atofindley, were brought together to form Bostik Findley SA and the name was subsequently changed in 2004 to Bostik SA.
In 2013, Bostik revisited its brand identity, with a new signature “smart adhesives” and a gecko inspired from nature with a science-based connection to Bostik’s adhesives business .
From pioneering waterproof boots to launching the first elastic attachment adhesive used in a baby diaper, our history is full of smart innovation.
Since 1889 we’ve patented over 9,000 technologies covering everything from aerospace interior adhesives to Blu-Tack. And we’ve evolved enormously along the way, growing from a local dye manufacturer to a global industry leader.

1913
Method of filling shoe bottom cavities
Patented September 2, 1913
“Be it known that I, Winthrop D. Baker, […] have invented new and useful improvement in methods of filling shoe-bottom cavities […]. This invention relates to the provision of shoe bottoms with filling materials between the outer and inner soles in order to give the shoe pliability.”
1917
Shoes sealing and waterproof boots
During World War I, United Shoe Machinery (USM) provided shoe machines and operator instructions entirely new in shoemaking. In 1917, they turned over a shoe repair caravan that could go anywhere, including the front lines. This experience led USM to produce resistant waterproof boots for soldiers.
1922
Quelyd
In 1922, Quellhyd introduced potato starch-based wallpaper paste onto the French market. The Doittau firm formulated their chemistry in Germany and drew inspiration from German to create the brand name (“Quellen”, to expand whilst cold and “Hyd”, using water). Wallpaper paste expanded with the addition of water to the powder, forming a thick texture. Quellhyd, renamed Quelyd in the 1960’s, has continued to be highly successful.
1950’s
Sealing and bonding solutions for automotive and aircraft
Bostik adhesive, sealing and glazing products were developed to be water and heat resistant, able to withstand temperatures ranging from -30 to 100° C. Some of these, were used in the construction of the Airspeed Ambassador in the early 50’s. During the same period, Bostik began producing innovative solutions for the automotive industry.
1954
First Neoprene based contact glue
Boston Blacking Company formulated rubber-based contact adhesives in 1954 to stick floor and decorative coverings to various surfaces that provided excellent resistance to vibrations. Its initial viscous composition is today more liquid, for easier and faster application.
1960's
Dispensing hot melts
In the 1960’s, USM developed a novel application technique for hot melts used in the footwear industry. The polyamide-based (and, later on, polyester-based) hot melt adhesive is delivered in bobbins and melted down as a continuous bead, facilitating automation of the bonding process.
1970
Blu Tack
®
British consumers are all familiar with Bostik’s synthetic putty product Blu Tack®, launched in the early 1970’s. As a strong but removable and reusable adhesive putty, Blu Tack® can be used everywhere and for several uses. Today, Blu Tack® is a mainstay of Bostik’s stationery and craft ranges, which are used all over the world.
1975
First elastic attachment adhesive for disposable diapers
“In 1975 in Milwaukee, we had clients who were trying to stick a rubber band to a polyethylene (plastic) film. The customer was developing the first diaper that had an elastic leg feature. It took us 20 attempts to get it right and we successfully produced the first elastic attachment adhesive for diapers ever made!”
Mark Alper, Bostik Inc.
Technical Manager, R&D Laboratory, Wauwatosa USA.
2001
First Silyl modified polymer-based elastic adhesives
In 2001, Bostik was the first to launch SMP’s: silyl modified polymer-based elastic adhesives. They are highly elastic, waterproof and adhere to all types of surfaces, indoors and outdoors and in all types of weather. They stick to everything, everywhere, from coat hooks to railway windshields to rivets on airplane wings. Nails, screws and bolts are becoming a thing of the past!
2003
First patented pressure sensitive adhesive for resealable food packaging
Bostik was the first to patent extrudable reseal adhesives and we continue to transform food packaging materials with this smart technology. The reseal adhesives provide a less wasteful, more environmentally-friendly and easier to use alternative to conventional non-resealable containers.
2019
Fix & Flash
In 2019, Bostik launches Fix & Flash, a professional technology that bonds on demand and on any material (even opaque) thanks to its drying UV system.
We continue to pursue innovation just as vigorously as our predecessors and we look forward with the confidence to the next 130 years of our history.

Adhesives and sealants designed for process efficiencies
Our smart adhesives include a wide range of technologies that cater to specific application needs, offering an easy-to-use process while still being cost-effective. Using smart technologies can reduce cycle time from two to six process steps while also reducing the quantity of adhesive per part. Bostik's leading technologies are available in all regions and have limited health and safety impact.
Applications
Through innovative technologies, material-to-material bonding expertise, and flexibility to form, we create bonds that keep your assembly line moving.
Watershield bonding: direct applied and pre-applied
The watershield is the thin flexible film layer that is bonded directly to the door frame. Watershields protect the electrical components of the door from any damage caused by external water sources. Our direct application adhesives are ideal for use in the assembly line, and our pre-applied adhesives are delivered on a liner, making them ideal for repositionable watershield processes.
Weatherstrip bonding
Automotive weatherstripping is used to protect vehicle interiors from the environment. Weatherstripping needs to be flexible in many aspects, such as the ability to accommodate the vibrations of the vehicle or withstand the extremes of both hot and cold temperatures. The weatherstrip needs an adhesive that is as flexible as the material it’s bonding.
Technologies
We have products in multiple chemistries suitable for bonding weatherstrips and watershields.
Our key technologies include:
Hot melt polybutene – This adhesive is permanently plastic and tacky and will not dry or crack. It offers heat and humidity resistance, excellent adhesion to plastic and metal and does not require a primer for steel or aluminium substrates.
Solvent based adhesive
PUR adhesive
Rubber adhesive
Water based adhesive
