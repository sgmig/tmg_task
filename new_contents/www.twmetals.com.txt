TW METALS CORPORATE WEB SITE AND BUSINESS UNITS WEB SITES
1.
APPLICATON OF CONDITIONS
. All sales of products (the Product) are made pursuant to the terms and conditions herein and all orders are received with the understanding that they are placed under those terms and conditions.
2.
MODIFICATION
. This agreement may not be amended, changed or modified except by a writing duly executed by Buyer and Seller, and it is expressly understood that in the case of Seller, any such writing shall be executed by an authorized representative of Seller.
3.
PRICES
. Prices are subject to change without notice. All orders are accepted subject to Seller's price in effect at the time of shipment. Seller reserves the right to revise prices if there is a change in quantity, size, analysis, finish or method and time of shipment differing from those covered in the original order.
4.
PAYMENT
. Buyer shall make payment to Seller in the manner set forth herein. If in the judgment of Seller the creditworthiness of Buyer becomes impaired at any time or Seller otherwise becomes insecure, Seller shall have the right to require payment in advance for making any future shipments and Seller may, upon seven days' written notice to Buyer, declare that the unpaid purchase prices of any Products not made when due shall accrue interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum or at the highest interest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever rate is less. At Seller's option, upon any breach or default by Buyer hereunder, any outstanding debt obligation or liability of Buyer to Seller, under this agreement or otherwise, shall be immediately due and payable. Time is of the essence with respect to all payments due to Seller from Buyer hereunder, and, unless in each instance waived by Seller in writing, timely payment shall be a condition precedent to any subsequent deliveries of Products or other performance by Seller of its duties and obligations hereunder.
5.
SECURITY INTEREST
. Seller shall have, and Buyer hereby grants to Seller, a security interest in all of the Products, and in any proceeds thereof, to secure payment of the purchase price of the Products, and seller shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code in force in the jurisdiction where Seller seeks to enforce any of such rights or remedies. If requested by Seller, Buyer shall sign and deliver to Seller such documents, in a form acceptable to Seller, as Seller may require in order to confirm or perfect its security interest in the Products and proceeds thereof.
6.
RISK OF LOSS
. All risk of loss or damage to any Products shall pass from Seller to Buyer upon Seller's delivery of such Products to the carrier designated in the shipping instructions contained herein, or to a carrier reasonably selected by Seller if such shipping instructions do not designate a carrier, for shipment to Buyer. Any changes by carrier at destination for spotting, switching, demurrage or other services shall be paid by Buyer. Any price quotations contained herein are price terms only, and risk of loss or damages and shipping terms are as separately provided in this agreement.
7.
DEFECTIVE, NONCONFORMING OR REJECTED MERCHANDISE
. Buyer shall inspect each shipment of Products by Seller to Buyer immediately upon arrival at the shipments destination, and within thirty days of each such arrival shall notify Seller of (a) any defects in any of the Products contained in such shipment and (b) any reason (other than any such defects) by which the Buyer claims any of such Products are nonconforming goods or for which Buyer rejects any of such Products, except that with respect to any claims for shortages, such claims must be made within five days after receipt. If Buyer fails to give such notice in the manner provided herein, all Products contained in any such shipment shall be deemed to conform to the contract and Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such Products. If any model or sample was shown to Buyer, such model or sample was used merely to illustrate the general type and quality of the Products and not to represent that the Products would necessarily be that type or nature.
In the event Buyer so notifies Seller of any defects in any of the Products, Buyer shall allow Seller the opportunity to inspect the Products in question, and if requested by Seller, shall return any such Products to Seller. In the event that Seller determines in its sole discretion that any defects in any such Products were not caused by Buyer or others after Seller packaged same for shipment to Buyer, Seller shall, at its option, either exchange, repair or provide Buyer with a refund or credit for the purchase price.
8.
BUYER'S INSPECTION
. Where source inspection is made by Buyer, Buyer's inspector shall be deemed to be the agent of the Buyer to accept material on Buyer's behalf with complete authority to waive specified test or details of test procedure, and to accept material which may deviate from formal specifications.
9.
PERMISSIBLE VARIATIONS, SIZE AND QUANTITY
. Seller does not accept responsibility for size ordered to cleanup to finished dimensions unless such size has been recommended in writing by Seller.

Titanium is lightweight, strong, corrosion resistant and abundant in nature. Titanium and its alloys possess tensile strengths from 30,000 psi to 200,000 psi (210-1380 MPa), which are equivalent to those Â strengths found in most of alloy steels. The density of titanium is only 56 percent that of steel, and its corrosion resistance compares well with that of platinum. Of all the elements in the earthâs crust, titanium is the ninth most plentiful. Titanium has a high melting point of 3135Â°F (1725Â°C). This melting point is approximately 400Â°F (220Â°C) above the melting point of steel and approximately 2000Â°F (1100Â°C) above that of aluminum.Â  It alsoÂ has the advantage ofÂ a very thin, conductive oxide surfaceÂ film, and a hard, smooth surface that limits adhesions of foreign materials.

TW Metals stocks aluminum bar for both aerospace and commercial applications. Since aluminum weighs approximately a third the weight of similar steel section, it is the obvious choice when weight is a factor.
Excellent resistance to corrosion permits its use without protection in most environments.Â  Aluminumâs ability to transmit heat rapidly and efficiently make it an ideal material for the heat transfer processes.Â  Aluminum bar can formed readily and has excellent weldability.

3003 Aluminum Sheet
3003 Aluminum Sheet
3003 aluminum coil and sheet is approximately 20% stronger than 1100 series aluminum. 3003 aluminum reacts well to mechanical finishings as well as organic finishes. 3003 welding is readily accomplished by means of conventional welding methods, but may be gummy if machined. Soldering is limited to the torch method.
TW has a wide range of sizes readily available to the AMS 4006 for O temper, AMS 4008 for H14.
