Fin Type: Copper Fin Tube
Tube Material: copper
Fin Material: Copper
Product description：
Copper finned tubes using the form of the base tube covered with aluminum tube(the base tube can be carbon steel, stainless steel, copper) through machine extrusion, forming a tube fin, the fin base and the tube outer wall is close fitting, this fin tubing control can make finned tubes with high heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer performance.
INQUIRY
Copper fin tube material
Copper is a metal element, and pure copper is a soft metal. The surface is reddish orange with metallic luster when it is just cut open, and its simple substance is purple-red. Good ductility, high thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, so it is the most commonly used material in cables and electrical and electronic components.
It can also be used as a building material and can be composed of many alloys. Copper alloys have excellent mechanical properties and low electrical resistivity. The most important ones are bronze and brass. In addition, copper is also a durable metal that can be recycled multiple times without compromising its mechanical properties.
Copper pipes (also known as red copper pipes) are commonly used in tap water pipes, heating and cooling pipes, and can be used in different environments. Copper pipes combine the advantages of metal and non-metal pipes in cold and hot water systems. Copper pipes are resistant to high temperatures and can be used in a variety of environments. Compared with this, the shortcomings of many other pipe materials are obvious.
For example, the galvanized steel pipes used in residential buildings in the past are very easy to rust. If they are not used for a long time, the tap water will turn yellow and the water flow will become small. In addition, the strength of some materials will decrease rapidly at high temperatures, which may cause unsafe risks when used in hot water pipes. The melting point of copper is as high as 1083 degrees Celsius, and the temperature of the hot water system is negligible for copper pipes.
China Copper Pipe is the best one and is the best connecting pipe. The copper pipe is fire-resistant and heat-resistant, and can maintain its shape and strength under high temperature without aging.
The pressure resistance of copper pipes is several times or even dozens of times that of plastic pipes and aluminum-plastic pipes. It can withstand the highest water pressure in today’s buildings. In the hot water environment, with the extension of service life, the pressure capacity of plastic pipes significantly decreases, and the mechanical properties of copper pipes remain unchanged in all thermal temperature ranges, so their pressure resistance will not decrease, nor there will be aging.
Copper finned tubes manufacturing process
Pipe line——compressing or rolling——strip peeling——washing——pressure test——blast blowing——packaging. The cold machining process of fins provides excellent mechanical resistance , fins are strong and have strong resistance to atmospheric corrosion, etc. The pressure required to extrude the fin from the aluminum sleeve creates an excellent “pressure bond” between the two materials. In addition, the aluminum finned material completely surrounds the metal of the tube, so there is no risk of electrical corrosion at the fin root (between the tube and the fin). All of these advantages ensure the most stable performance over time of all other fin types.
Copper finned tube applications
Copper finned tubes
products are widely used in petrochemical, power plant and power plant renovation, air conditioning and refrigeration, boilers, finned tube economizers and air preheaters.

Condenser coil
Condenser Coil
Fin Type: Coil
Tube Material: copper
Fin Material: Copper
Product description：
The condenser coil is where the heat is removed from the refrigerant. After the gas refrigerant is pressurized and heated in the compressor, it enters the condenser coil。 Simultaneously, the refrigerant cools and turns into a liquid. The air around the coil will start to heat up and is blown out of the outdoor unit.
INQUIRY
How does condenser coil works
While the evaporator coil picks up heat from indoor air, the condenser coil releases heat into outdoor air. The load of heat energy extracted from your home and compressed in hot refrigerant vapor is rapidly released when refrigerant circulates into the coil and condenses to liquid.
What’s the Difference Between A/C Condenser coil and Evaporator Coils?
Extracting indoor heat from the air and adding it to refrigerant is the function of the evaporator coil. Installed inside the indoor air handler, the evaporator is continuously exposed to the flow of warm air drawn by the system blower from individual rooms in the house through return ducts.
Refrigerant circulating through copper tubes in the coil is a cold vapor around 40 degrees. In this state, the heat-absorbent properties of the refrigerant are maximized. Heat energy from the warm house airflow transfers through the chilled copper coil tubing and is readily absorbed by the refrigerant flow. With its heat energy extracted by the coil, the cooled airflow is pushed by the blower into the supply ducts and dispersed throughout the house.
At the same time heat is being extracted, the warm air contacting frigid evaporator coil surfaces triggers condensation, which lowers the humidity level in the airflow, “conditioning” the air just as Willis Carrier designed over a century ago. After leaving the evaporator coil, refrigerant flows through an insulated conduit to the outdoor A/C component that’s usually directly behind the house.
This cabinet contains both the compressor and the condenser coil. Refrigerant entering the compressor is pressurized, concentrating the molecules of heat energy and raising the temperature of the refrigerant vapor to over 100 degrees. This superheated state ensures efficient transfer of the heat energy into outdoor air, even when the outdoor temperature is high, such as on a hot summer day.
The
condenser
coil is of similar design to the indoor evaporator coil. However, the difference between A/C evaporator and condenser coil is exactly reversed. While the evaporator coil picks up heat from indoor air, the condenser coil releases heat into outdoor air. The load of heat energy extracted from your home and compressed in hot refrigerant vapor is rapidly released when refrigerant circulates into the coil and condenses to liquid.
As the refrigerant releases its heat load, a fan incorporated in the unit blows air through the condenser coil passages and heat is dispersed into outdoor air. High-pressure liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser coil makes a u-turn and flows back to the evaporator coil. An expansion valve before the evaporator restricts the flow of refrigerant, forcing it through a narrow orifice and converting it back to a vaporized state, ready to absorb more heat energy from your home.

Product description： High-frequency finned tube works with high-frequency power source as a heat source, the steel strip, steel pipe heating at the same time, so that they melt into one. It has the characteristics of high heat transfer and heat dissipation efficiency, large heat transfer area, long service life, wide adaptability to temperature and high pressure.
INQUIRY
High frequency finned tube
The basic principle of
finned tube
is to take the seamless steel tube on the outer packing band with a certain distance (strip perpendicular to the outer surface of the tube) and high-frequency current welding as the heat source. By using the skin effect and electrical effect of high-frequency current, the local heating tube, the steel strip and the contact surface area to be welded can be plastically welded. At the same time, the forging force of finned tube is applied to the metal oxide and the plastic form of the contact outside of the excess melt, so as to realize the combination of solid atoms between the steel tube and the finned material
High frequency finned tubes features
The high-frequency welding finned tube uses the skin effect and proximity effect of the high-frequency current to heat the steel strip and the outer surface of the steel tube while the steel strip is wound around the steel tube until it is in a plastic state or melted. Under a certain pressure of winding the steel strip Finish welding. This high-frequency welding is actually a solid phase welding. Compared with inlay, brazing (or overall hot-dip galvanizing) and other methods, it is more advanced in terms of product quality (high fin welding rate, up to 95%), productivity and automation .
(1) High production efficiency, continuous winding production;
(2) Low cost, it depends on the characteristics of high-frequency welding itself — skin effect heating workpiece surface, to achieve the purpose of welding, welding process does not need to add any filler metal materials;
(3) Since the high-frequency current only passes on the shallow surface of the steel tube, the welding heat affected zone is small, so the additional wall thickness caused by this need not be considered in the design calculation; No heat treatment is required after the workpiece is welded.
(4) Solid welding, in the equipment configuration reasonable, process parameters perfect under the circumstances, can achieve between the fin and steel pipe welding firm, can withstand frequent open, shutdown caused by the thermal shock wave.

Stainless steel pipe
Fin Type: pipe
Tube Material: stainless steel
Product description：
Stainless steel pipe is a hollow long round steel, which is widely used in petroleum, chemical, medical, food, light industry, mechanical instrumentation and other industrial pipelines and mechanical structural parts. In addition, when the bending and torsion strength are the same, the weight is lighter, so it is also widely used in the manufacture of mechanical parts and engineering structures. Also often used as furniture and kitchen utensils.
INQUIRY
Sta
inless steel pipe hardness
Stainless steel
pipes generally use three hardness indicators, Brinell, Rockwell, and Vickers to measure their hardness.
Sta
inless steel pipe brinell hardness
Among the stainless steel pipe standards, Brinell hardness is the most widely used, and the hardness of the material is often expressed by the indentation diameter, which is both intuitive and convenient. But it is not suitable for steel pipes of harder or thinner steel.
Sta
inless steel pipe rockwell hardness
The Rockwell hardness test of stainless steel pipe is the same as the Brinell hardness test, which is the indentation test method. The difference is that it measures the depth of the indentation. Rockwell hardness test is currently a widely used method, among which HRC is second only to Brinell hardness HB in steel pipe standards. Rockwell hardness can be used to measure metal materials from extremely soft to extremely hard.
It makes up for the difference of the Brinell method and is simpler than the Brinell method. The hardness value can be read directly from the dial of the hardness machine. However, due to its small indentation, the hardness value is not as accurate as the Brinell method.
Sta
inless steel pipe vickers hardness
Stainless steel pipe Vickers hardness test is also an indentation test method, which can be used to determine the hardness of very thin metal materials and surface layers. It has the main advantages of Brinell and Rockwell method, and overcomes their basic shortcomings, but it is not as simple as Rockwell method. Vickers method is rarely used in steel pipe standards.
Sta
inless steel pipe hardness testing
For stainless steel pipes with an inner diameter above 6.0mm and wall thickness below 13mm, the W-B75 Webster hardness tester can be used. The test is very fast and simple, and it is suitable for quick and non-destructive qualification inspection of stainless steel pipes. For stainless steel pipes with an inner diameter greater than 30mm and a wall thickness greater than 1.2mm, use Rockwell hardness tester to test the hardness of HRB and HRC.
For stainless steel pipes with an inner diameter greater than 30mm and a wall thickness less than 1.2mm, the surface Rockwell hardness tester is used to test the hardness of HRT or HRN. For stainless steel pipes with an inner diameter less than 0mm and greater than 4.8mm, use a special Rockwell hardness tester for pipes to test the hardness of HR15T. When the inner diameter of the stainless steel pipe is greater than 26mm, the hardness of the inner wall of the pipe can also be tested with a Rockwell or surface Rockwell hardness tester.

INQUIRY
U bend tube manufacturing
1. Punching method: Expand the pipe end to the required size and shape, with a tapered core on the punch.
Second, the bending method: There are three commonly used methods: one is the stretching method, the other is the stamping method, and the third is the roller method. There are 3-4 rollers, 2 fixed rollers, and 1 adjusting roller. , Adjust the fixed roll distance, and the finished pipe will bend.
2. Bulging method: one is to put the rubber in the tube and squeeze the upper part with a punch to make the tube protrude; the other is hydraulic expansion, which fills the middle of the pipe with liquid, and the liquid pressure makes the elbow expand into Need shape, most corrugated pipes are produced in this way.
3. Forging method: The end or part of the pipe is pulled out by a die forging machine to reduce the outer diameter of the pipe. The commonly used forging machinery is rotary, connecting rod, and roller type. Roller type: Put the core in the tube and push the roller outside to process the round edges.
4. Rolling method: generally without mandrel, suitable for the inner edge of thick-walled pipe.
First of all: According to the simmering process, there are mainly two types of hot simmering elbows and cold simmering elbows.
1. Hot simmering elbow
Hot simmering elbow is also called intermediate frequency elbow, and its production process belongs to the range of thermal expansion.
Manufacturing of hot simmering elbow:
After cutting the material, the straight pipe is placed on the induction ring of the bent part of the steel pipe, the pipe head is clamped by the mechanical rotating arm, and the intermediate frequency current is used to heat the steel pipe in the induction ring. When the temperature of the steel pipe rises to the plastic state, the mechanical thrust of the steel pipe at the rear end of the steel pipe pushes to bend, and the elbow part is quickly cooled with coolant, so that the elbow pipe is continuously bent while heating, pushing, bending and cooling.
Hot simmering elbows are mainly used in industries such as circular steel structures, tunnel support, curved roof beams, subway engineering, aluminum doors and windows, ceilings, inner skeletons of packaging tubes, balcony handrails, shower doors, production line tracks, fitness equipment and other industries.
2. Cold simmering elbow
Production of cold simmering bends:
Cold simmering elbow is a bending method that does not heat or change the material structure at room temperature.
U bend tube applications
1. In various bends, various bends are inevitably used, such as marine pipelines, automobile oil pipes and other pipelines. Compared with other types of elbows, the arc elbow has many advantages. First, all kinds of materials flow smoothly at the arc elbow, and the impact force on the pipe wall is small and uniform; secondly, the arc elbow itself has less stress concentration. Strong and high impact resistance;
2. With the rise of modern steel furniture, office chairs, beach chairs, luggage carts, shopping carts, children’s trolleys, cribs, computer tables, etc., several metal tubes form several bright lines, which are practical, convenient, safe and reliable ；
3.
Air conditioning refrigeration
pipes mainly include elbows, small U-shaped pipes, return elbows, etc.;
4. The bathroom industry now has more and more bends, faucets, towel racks and S-shaped accessories.
5. Motorcycles, automobiles, electric vehicles, bicycles and other vehicles, handlebars, bumpers, frames, etc.;
6. Fitness equipment, lighting, construction machinery and other industries.

What is finned tube coil
Finned tube
coils are commonly used for gas-liquid exchange. Heat transfer on the gas side is usually much lower than on the liquid side, and heat sinks are required on the gas side. The outer fins of the tube may be normal on a single tube, or maybe transverse, spiral, or longitudinal. Longitudinal fins are commonly used in a double tube or shell heat exchangers without baffles. A fluid may be a gas or a viscous liquid. Our finned tube coil products range from small applications to large commercial and industrial projects.
Finned tube coil material
Tube:  copper, steel or stainless steel
Fins: aluminum, copper, steel or stainless steel
Finned tube coil type
Spiral wound – crimped fin wound along tube length
Water to air
Steam to air
Refrigerant to air
Oil to air
Run-around coils (air to air heat recovery)
Finned tube coil applications
Industrial Coils: heat exchangers, boilers, petroleum, chemical, fertilizer, chemical fiber, nuclear power, etc. Coils for fluids: beverages, beer, milk, water supply systems, equipment, etc. Coil for mechanical structures: printing and dyeing, printing, textile machinery, appliances, kitchen equipment, automobile and ship accessories, construction and decoration, etc.
For example:
The fin tube coil is widely used in the distillation condenser and solvent cooler of the washing machine, and is an ideal accessory product; the tube and the fin of the finned tube are an integrated structure, and the heat transfer capacity is increased by 30% compared with the smooth tube -40%, widely used in the washing industry; the surface can be treated with electrophoresis, electroless nickel plating, tin plating and other anti-corrosion processes, which can greatly improve the corrosion resistance.

L/LL/LK Finned Tube
Fin Type: Fin Tube
Tube Material: Carbon steel, stainless steel, copper, aluminum
Fin Material: Copper, aluminum
Fin Tube Length: No Limit
Product description：L/LL/KL  finned tube: Working temperature: 230℃. Features: Adopting the winding process, the production efficiency is high, the lamella distance is uniform, the heat transfer is good, the finization ratio is high, the base tube can be protected from air erosion.
INQUIRY
L/LL/KL Finned Tube
Finned tube is a tube with small finned fins around its outer surface. These fins act as a filter and a mechanism for transferring heat from the material inside the tube to or from the outer space. Finned tubes are used in applications where heat is transferred from a hot fluid to a cooler fluid through the wall of the tube. The rate at which this heat transfer occurs depends on three factors:
The difference in temperature between the two fluids.
The coefficient of heat transfer between each fluid and the wall.
Surface area of fluid exposure.
L type
finned tube
:   Adopting the winding process, the production efficiency is high, uniform lamella distance , good heat transfer, high finization ratio, the base tube can be protected from air erosion. The aluminum fin or copper fin is folded into an L shape and continuously spirally wound on the outer surface of the base tube under the action of tension.
Maximum working temperature-150°C (302°F), acceptable for atmospheric corrosion resistance, poor mechanical resistance. Commonly used heat sink materials are aluminum and copper.
LL typefinned tube: Under the L-shaped foundation, the fin root completely covers the outer surface of the base tube; to some extent, this fin type guarantees better corrosion resistance.
Maximum working temperature-180°C (356°F), acceptable for atmospheric corrosion resistance, poor mechanical resistance. Commonly used heat sink materials are aluminum and copper
KL type finned tube: Before the fins are continuously wound on the surface of the steel pipe, the outer surface of the base pipe needs to undergo a knurling process; after the fins are wound, the root of the fin attached to the steel pipe will also be knurled to strengthen the steel pipe and Combination of fins. For this reason, this fin type ensures better heat transfer characteristics under the fins of L and LL.
Maximum working temperature-260°C (500°F), acceptable for atmospheric corrosion resistance, poor mechanical resistance. Commonly used heat sink materials are aluminum and copper
L/LL/KL Finned Tube applications
Application: Mainly used in air coolers in petrochemical, electric power, paper making, tobacco, building heating and other industries, air heaters and air heaters in spray drying systems such as vegetable protein and starch in the food industry. Blast furnace and converter systems, power generation: condensate exhaust gas discharged from steam turbines, condensate contact cycle cooling condensation, fossil and nuclear power plants, air conditioners (Freon, ammonia, propane), waste incineration equipment, compressor coolers, etc.
We customized finned tube according to customer indivisual requirement, for more details about L/LL/KL finned tube please inquire us!

Stainless steel coil applications
Stainless steel coils are widely used in chemical, machinery, electronics, electric power, textiles, rubber, food, medical equipment, aviation, aerospace, communications, petroleum and other industrial fields.
Industrial stainless steel coils: heat exchangers, boilers, petroleum, chemicals, fertilizers, chemical fibers, pharmaceuticals, nuclear power, etc.
Stainless steel coils for fluids: beverages, beer, milk, water supply systems, medical equipment, etc.
Stainless steel coils for mechanical structures: printing and dyeing, printing, textile machinery, medical equipment, kitchen equipment, automobile and ship accessories, construction and decoration, etc.
Bright stainless steel coil: welded with stainless steel strips, then reduce the wall, reducing the wall thickness from thick to thin. This process can make the wall thickness uniform and smooth, and the reduced-wall stretched tube wall forms a weld-free effect. According to the naked eye, it is a seamless pipe, but its process is determined to be a welded pipe.
The process of wall reduction is accompanied by bright annealing, so that the inner and outer walls will not form an oxide layer, and the inner and outer walls are bright and beautiful, which is really needed for medical products. The next process requires sizing, that is, the process of large and small drawing, to determine the outer diameter, the outer diameter tolerance can generally reach plus or minus 0.01mm.
